I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing\never written. I still think it is.\nTo invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-\nspheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.\nWhat’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-\nsions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-\nwork. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper\nframework. You must supply the emotional discipline.\nIf you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra-\nham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable\nadvice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from\nyour investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment\nthan you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results\nwill depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-\nments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-\nvail during your investing career. The sillier the market’s behavior,\nthe greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow\nGraham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.\nTo me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher.\nMore than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.\nShortly after Ben’s death in 1976, I wrote the following short\nremembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal.

      "text": "ix Preface to the Fourth Edition\nBENJAMIN GRAHAM\n1894–1976\nSeveral years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend\nthe thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish, something\ncreative and something generous.”\nThe inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-\naging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or\nself-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was\nunfailingly gentle.\nReaders of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as\nmeasured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-\npline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.\nBut over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure\nand logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-\nsible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security\nanalysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months\nafter publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often\nenhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that\ndemolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness\nbrought unfailing rewards to his followers—even to those with natural\nabilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-\ning counsels of brilliance or fashion.\nAremarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was\nthat he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-\ntrates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of\nan intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have\nnever met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,\nunending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a\nform applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his\nthinking in any field a delight.\nBut his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond\nall others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each\nrelationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there\nwas an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,\nand spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to\ngo. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.\nWalter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit\nunder. Ben Graham was such a man.\nReprintewd fwromw t.hfex F1in6an1cia8l .Acnoalymsts Journal,November/December 1976.",

      "text": "A Note About Benjamin Graham\nby Jason Zweig\nW\nho was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?\nGraham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was\nalso the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,\nmoney managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by\nsuperstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis\nwas the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-\nfession.1\nAnd The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for\nindividual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that\nare essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on\ninvesting ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor\nwas the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub\nreporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner\nor later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-\nfered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,\nafter the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market\nthat began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investorreads more prophet-\nically than ever.)\nGraham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the\nanguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and\npsychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on\nMay 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and\nfigurines.2The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At\nfirst they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-\n1Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.\n2The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,\nwhenw Gwermwan.f-sxo1un6d1ing8 n.acmoems were regarded with suspicion.\nx",

But Ben’s father died in 1903, the\nporcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.\nBen’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-\ning money to trade stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash\nof 1907. For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of\ncashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is\nDorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”\nFortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his\nbrilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his\nclass. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—\nEnglish, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the faculty.\nHe was all of 20 years old.\nInstead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.\nHe started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,\nthen a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-\nnership.\nThe Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In\nApril 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for\nSavold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by\nOctober, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock\nwas worthless.\nGraham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,\nalmost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure\nreports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-\nmission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $65\nper share—held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He\nbought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and\ncame away with $110 per share three years later.)\nDespite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of\n1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting\nbargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact\nrecord of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in\n1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,\nversus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-\nterm track records on Wall Street history.3\n3Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)\nthat Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his\nown righwt.

      "text": "A Note About Benjamin Graham xii\nHow did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual\npowers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham\ndeveloped his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they\nwere during his lifetime:\n• A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an\nownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value\nthat does not depend on its share price.\n• The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-\nable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified\npessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor\nis a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\n• The future value of every investment is a function of its present\nprice. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.\n• No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever\neliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what\nGraham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-\nter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize\nyour odds of error.\n• The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you\nbecome a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,\nand you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady\nadvantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your\ndiscipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood\nswings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-\nments behave is much less important than how you behave.\nThe goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investoris to apply\nGraham’s ideas to today’s financial markets while leaving his text\nentirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4 After\neach of Graham’s chapters you’ll find a new commentary.

Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of\nanalyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment\nprinciples and investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a\nnumber of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in\npairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—\nin order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements\ninvolved in specific choices of common stocks.\nBut much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns\nof financial markets, in some cases running back over many\ndecades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-\narmed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of\nbonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-\ntions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s\nown experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to\nWall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do\nnot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\nOur text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-\ntors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all\nbut forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a\n“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to\nriches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up\nwhat we have just said by a bit of financial history—especially\nsince there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-\nmactic year 1929 John J.

If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was\nindeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our\nrough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks\nmaking up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates\nthat if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,\nthe investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been\nworth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise\nof $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such\noptimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should\nremark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation\nwould have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this\ndespite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases\nwith the DJIAat 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948\nclosing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive\nargument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong\ncommon stocks through thick and thin—a program known as\n“dollar-cost averaging.”\nSince our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant\nfor those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided\nby charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the\nright moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to\nnearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should\nbuybecausea stock or the market has gone up and one should sell\nbecauseit has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business\nsense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to\n*Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-\npany, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He also\nserved as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the driving\nforce behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by\nfinance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s plan would have\ngrown to just under $9,000 after 20 years, although inflation would have\neaten away much of that gain.

In our own stock-market experience\nand observation, extending over 50 years, we have not known a\nsingle person who has consistently or lastingly made money by\nthus “following the market.” We do not hesitate to declare that this\napproach is as fallacious as it is popular. We shall illustrate what\nwe have just said—though, of course this should not be taken as\nproof—by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow theory for\ntrading in the stock market.*\nSince its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent\nInvestorhave appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In\nupdating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a\nnumber of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.\nThese include:\n1. An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade\nbonds.\n2. A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common\nstocks, ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage\ndecline in some 30 years. (Countless issues of lower quality\nhad a much larger shrinkage.)\n3. A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices,\nwhich gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-\neral business in 1970.\n4. The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, fran-\nchise operations, and other relative novelties in business and\nfinance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as “let-\nter stock,”1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading\nnames, use of foreign banks, and others.)†\n*Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and pp. 191–192.\nFor more detail on the Dow Theory, see http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/\ndow/dowpage.html.\n†Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then immedi-\nately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s definition\non p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report unsustainably high\nreturns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\ncracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund\ninvestors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of\ninvestment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,\nwith disquieting results.\nThese phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some\nwill require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-\nous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should\nnot alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-\nples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-\nnisms and climate.\nThe last statement was put to the test during the writing of the\npresent edition, the first draft of which was finished in January\n1971. At that time the DJIAwas in a strong recovery from its 1970\nlow of 632 and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with\nattendant general optimism. As the last draft was finished, in\nNovember 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-\nrying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its\nfuture. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general\nattitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-\ntially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.\nThe extent of the market’s shrinkage in 1969–70 should have\nserved to dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground dur-\ning the past two decades. This was that leading common stocks\ncould be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not\nonly of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon\nbe recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-\n*The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in the\nUnited States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970—shocking\ninvestors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see\np. 423).

At long last the stock market has\n“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock\ninvestors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-\nhaps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.\nIn the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,\nespecially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the\nlast market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in\nitself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there\nwas now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment\nfunds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously\novervalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who\nneeds to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for\ngreat accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-\nably leads to disaster.\nThe major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the\nhuge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967\nthe investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much\nincome from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-\ntive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%\non highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.\n(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of\n1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949\nthe figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only\n2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2In previous editions we have\nconsistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s\nportfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general\na 50–50 division between the two media. We must now consider\nwhether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock\nyields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-\ntionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-\ntinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision\nhere. Achapter will be devoted to this discussion.*\n* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-\ning in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average) yielded 1.9%.

      "text": "6 Introduction\nIn the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds\nof investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive”\nand the “enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will\nplace his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or\nlosses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and\nthe need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of\nthe enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness\nto devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both\nsound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades\nan enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile\nreward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average\nreturn than that realized by the passive investor. We have some\ndoubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to\nthe active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the\nyears after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to\ndevote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as\nthey existed in former periods and may return.\nIt has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-\nful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that\nare most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the\nmost promising companies in these industries. For example, smart\ninvestors—or their smart advisers—would long ago have recog-\nnized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a\nwhole and of International Business Machines in particular. And\nsimilarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-\npanies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To\nbring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that\nwe included first in the 1949 edition of this book.\nSuch an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport\nstocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than\nthe trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the\nvalue of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls\nlurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive\ntechnique that will help him along his path.*\n*“Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement in the late\n1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later.

It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of\nair traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this\nfactor their shares became a favorite choice of the investment\nfunds. But despite the expansion of revenues—at a pace even\ngreater than in the computer industry—a combination of techno-\nlogical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-\ning and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a\nnew high in traffic figures, the airlines sustained a loss of some\n$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in\n1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a\ngreater decline in 1969–70 than did the general market. The record\nshows that even the highly paid full-time experts of the mutual\nfunds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of\na major and nonesoteric industry.\nOn the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial\ninvestments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its\napparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about\nits rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%\nof their funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of\nthis excellent choice on their overall results was by no means\ndecisive. Furthermore, many—if not most—of their investments in\ncomputer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been\nunprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals\nfor our readers:\n1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not\ntranslate into obvious profits for investors.\n2.

Our main\nobjective will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible\nsubstantial error and to develop policies with which he will be\ncomfortable. We shall say quite a bit about the psychology of\ninvestors. For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his\nworst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is\nnot in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves....”) This\nhas proved the more true over recent decades as it has become\nmore necessary for conservative investors to acquire common\nstocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement\nand the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,\nand exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper\nmental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.\nWehave seen much more money made and keptby “ordinary peo-\nple” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment\nprocess than by those who lacked this quality, even though they\nhad an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-\nmarket lore.\nAdditionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to\nmeasure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at\nsome price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price\nthey would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-\ning what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in\ninvestment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago\nwe advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-\nceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses\nof the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were\nrealized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to\nask “How much?”\nIn June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by\nthe magic figure 9.40%—the yield obtainable on new offerings of\nhigh-grade public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about\n7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other\nanswer?” But there are other possible answers, and these must be\ncarefully considered.

Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our\nchief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues\nselling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for\nthis seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-\ncal. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good\ngrowth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of\nsuch shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations\nof the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of\npublic-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always\nconsider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding\nbusinesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what the\nstock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such\na conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting\nadventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated\ngrowth.\nThe art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally\nappreciated. Acreditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved\nby the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to\nimprove this easily attainable standard requires much application\nand more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a\nlittleextra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment\nprogram, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you\nmay well find that you have done worse.\nSince anyone—by just buying and holding a representative\nlist—can equal the performance of the market averages, it would\nseem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as\na matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail\nis surprisingly large.

Allied to the foregoing\nis the record of the published stock-market predictions of the\nbrokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated\nforecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing\nof a coin.\nIn writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of\ninvestment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have\nbeen emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-\nsified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carry\nout with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe\nand sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-\ning difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before\nattempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself\nand of his advisers—particularly as to whether they have a clear\nconcept of the differences between investment and speculation and\nbetween market price and underlying value.\nA strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the\nmargin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a\ndecision to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured\nfruits of defensive investment should not be made without much\nself-examination.\nA final retrospective thought. When the young author entered\nWall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next\nhalf-century had in store.

Yet if we confine our attention to American investment\nexperience, there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last 57\nyears. Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-\nshaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound\ninvestment principles produced generally sound results. We must\nact on the assumption that they will continue to do so.\nNote to the Reader:This book does not address itself to the overall\nfinancial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that\nportion of their funds which they are prepared to place in mar-\nketable (or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks.\nwww.fx1618.com",

What exactly does Gra-\nham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this\nbook, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of\nintelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means\nbeing patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to\nharness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,\nexplains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.”2\nThere’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to\nmake an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management\nL.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer\nscientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than\n$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market\nwould return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming\nmore and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money\nthat its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3\nAnd back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in\nthe South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that\nthe market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that\nhe “could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the\nmadness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-\neting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in\nthe wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much\nhigher price—and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today’s\nmoney). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words\n“South Sea” in his presence.4\n2Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor(Harper & Row, 1949), p. 4.\n3A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the government,\ninvested aggressively for wealthy clients.

But, in Graham’s terms,\nNewton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the\ncrowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted\nlike a fool.\nIn short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’re\nstupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed the\nemotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,\nGraham describes how to enhance your intelligence by harnessing\nyour emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-\nity. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is\nmore a matter of “character” than “brain.”\nA CHRONICLE OF CALAMITY\nNow let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-\nopments of the past few years:\n1. The worst market crash since the Great Depression, with U.S.\nstocks losing 50.2% of their value—or $7.4 trillion—between\nMarch 2000 and October 2002.\n2. Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of\nthe 1990s, including AOL, Cisco, JDS Uniphase, Lucent, and\nQualcomm—plus the utter destruction of hundreds of Internet\nstocks.\n3.

The bankruptcies of such once-glistening companies as Con-\nseco, Global Crossing, and WorldCom.\n5.

As Graham\nputs it, “while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplish-\nments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”\nBy letting themselves get carried away—on Internet stocks, on big\n“growth” stocks, on stocks as a whole—many people made the same\nstupid mistakes as Sir Isaac Newton.

You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You\ndon’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone\nelse.”6\n• In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer pro-\nclaimed that Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth\nowning right now.” These “winners of the new world,” as he called\nthem, “are the only ones that are going higher consistently in\ngood days and bad.” Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: “You\nhave to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that\nexisted before the Web....If we used any of what Graham and\nDodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under management.”7\nAll these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warn-\ning: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not\ntranslate into obvious profits for investors.” While it seems easy to\nforesee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real\nvalue if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By\nthe time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best\nmoney at him, flinging more than $100 million into his fund over the next\nyear. A $10,000 investment in the Monument Internet Fund in May 1999\nwould have shrunk to roughly $2,000 by year-end 2002.

Cramer’s favorite\nstocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By year-end\n2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a $10,000 investment\nspread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%, leaving you\nwith a grand total of $597.44.

But make sure you\nremember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing”\nwill be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely\nto be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.\nTHE SILVER LINING\nIf no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve\nreached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The\npendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational\nexuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27\nbillion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-\nrities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cut\nback on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to\nbuy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,\ntherefore, becoming expensive—sold stocks as they went down in\nprice and, by definition, became cheaper.\nAs Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly back-\nwards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,\nnot less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices\nfall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks\nmore costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash\non hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear\nmarket, since it puts stocks back on sale.8\nSo take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news\neveryone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now\nis a considerably safer—and saner—time to be building wealth. Read\non, and let Graham show you how.\n8The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced stage of\nretirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even an\nelderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone\ndown in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones\nbut deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs\nfor tax purposes.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Throughout this book the\nterm will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far back\nas 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1 we attempted a precise\nformulation of the difference between the two, as follows: “An\ninvestment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-\nises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not\nmeeting these requirements are speculative.”\nWhile we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the\nensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that\nhave occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.\nAfter the great market decline of 1929–1932 all common stocks\nwere widely regarded as speculative by nature. (Aleading author-\nity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)\nThus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that\nit gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.\nNow our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our\nreaders from accepting the common jargon which applies the term\n“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market.

Think of our suggested definition of investment given\nabove, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an\ninexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what\nhe is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he\nwill be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-\nevant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market\nhad already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-\nting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time\nas possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used\nphrase “reckless investors” could be regarded as a laughable con-\ntradiction in terms—something like “spendthrift misers”—were\nthis misuse of language not so mischievous.\nThe newspaper employed the word “investor” in these\ninstances because, in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone\nwho buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of\nwhat he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for\ncash or on margin. Compare this with the attitude of the public\ntoward common stocks in 1948, when over 90% of those queried\nexpressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common\nstocks.3About half gave as their reason “not safe, a gamble,” and\nabout half, the reason “not familiar with.”* It is indeed ironical\n*The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of\nMichigan and was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July, 1948.\nPeople were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He\ncan either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think\nwould be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays—put it in\nthe bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common\nstock with it?” Only 4% thought common stock would offer a “satisfactory”\nreturn; 26% considered it “not safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through\n1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,\nwww.fx1618.com",

We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-\ntion would be well advised to reinstate this distinction and to\nemphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock\nexchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,\nwhich those who suffered them had not been properly warned\nagainst. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-\nrassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from\nthe inclusion of speculative common stocks in their own capital\nfunds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably\nclear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-\nments—risks which are inseparable from the opportunities of\nprofit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the\ninvestor’s calculations.\nWhat we have just said indicates that there may no longer be\nsuch a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-\nsentative common stocks—in the sense that one can always wait to\nbuy them at a price that involves no risk of a market or “quota-\ntional” loss large enough to be disquieting. In most periods the\ninvestor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his\ncommon-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component\nwithin minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-\nically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.\nTwo paragraphs should be added about stock speculation per\nse, as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent\naveraging 18.7% annually. In a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a\npoll conducted by BusinessWeekat year-end 2002 found that only 24% of\ninvestors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios,\ndown from 47% just three years earlier.\nwww.fx1618.com",

More than that, some speculation is necessary and\nunavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-\nstantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein\nmust be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as\nthere is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which\nspeculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1)\nspeculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-\nously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge\nand skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you\ncan afford to lose.\nIn our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates\non margin† should recognize that he is ipso factospeculating, and it\nis his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a\nso-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any\nway similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation\nis always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead\nof the game.

Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never elimi-\nnated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary\nrisk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual\nrisk—the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!\n†A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow\nfrom the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more\nwhen your stocks go up—but you can be wiped out when they go down.

Never mingle\nyour speculative and investment operations in the same account,\nnor in any part of your thinking.\nResults to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor\nWe have already defined the defensive investor as one inter-\nested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother. In general what\ncourse should he follow and what return can he expect under\n“average normal conditions”—if such conditions really exist? To\nanswer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on\nthe subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have\noccurred since then in the underlying factors governing the\ninvestor’s expectable return, and finally what he should do and\nwhat he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.\n1. What We Said Six Years Ago\nWerecommended that the investor divide his holdings between\nhigh-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion\nheld in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the\nconverse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;\nthat his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion\nbetween the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when\nmarket developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As\nan alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock\ncomponent to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,”\nand conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he\nfelt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly\nattractive.”\nIn 1965 the investor could obtain about 41⁄% on high-grade tax-\n2\nable bonds and 31⁄% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return\n4\non leading common stocks (with the DJIAat 892) was only about\n3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at\nnormal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain\nan initial dividend return of between 31⁄% and 41⁄% on his stock\n2 2\npurchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-\ning value (and in the “normal market price”) of a representative\nwww.fx1618.com",

The half\n2\nand half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%\nbefore income tax. We added that the stock component should\ncarry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power\ncaused by large-scale inflation.\nIt should be pointed out that the above arithmetic indicated\nexpectation of a much lower rate of advance in the stock market\nthan had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-\naged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it\nwas quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly\nsatisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people\nwere willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate\nof advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”\nand hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not\nvery good but badresults for the future.”4\n2. What Has Happened Since 1964\nThe major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on\nfirst-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since\nbeen a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The\nobtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄% and\n2\neven more against 41⁄% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend\n2\nreturn on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-\nket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is\nless than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going\ninterest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the\nmarket price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this\nperiod.\nThere is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we\ndiscussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be\ntoo high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not\nconsider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to\nthe price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we\nknow of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary\nwidely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light\nof what has since happened we think that this warning—with\nattendant examples—was insufficiently stressed.

The DJIAat its recurrent price level of 900 in\n1971 yields only 3.5%.\nLet us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision\nto be made is how to divide the fund between high-grade bonds\n(or other so-called “cash equivalents”) and leading DJIA-type\nstocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-\nditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant\nupward or a significant downward movement for some time in the\nfuture? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse\nchange, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-\nrent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average\nannual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this\nappreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-\nous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-\ntributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his\nstocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-\nest on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return\non stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5This would be about the\nsame as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.\nThese expectations are much less favorable for stocks against\nbonds than they were in our 1964 analysis. (That conclusion fol-\nlows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up\nmuch more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight\n*How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems, very\nwell: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned\nan annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period\nfor his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-\nyear time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this\nperiod, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his\nchapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation,”\nwhich essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the\ncurrent dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield\nof just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around\n2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly\n6% is plausible.

Consequently we are\nforced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bond\ninvestment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If we\ncould be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise\nthe defensive investor to put all his money in bonds and none in\ncommon stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-\ncantly in favor of stocks.\nBut of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-\nter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediately\nthink of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In\nthe next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experience\nwith inflation in the United States during this century would not\nsupport the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials\nin yield.

We shall give our\nmore detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.\nSince at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks\nis nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectable\nreturn (including growth of stock values) for the investor would\nchange little regardless of how he divides his fund between the\ntwo components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from\nboth parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free\n(or estimated tax-paid) basis.

It may not seem attractive in relation to\nthe 14%, or so, return shown by common stocks during the 20\nyears of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be\nremembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIAhad\nadvanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had\nabout doubled. Hence the greater part of the impressive market\nrecord for that period was based on a change in investors’ and\nspeculators’ attitudes rather than in underlying corporate values.\nTo that extent it might well be called a “bootstrap operation.”\nIn discussing the common-stock portfolio of the defensive\ninvestor, we have spoken only of leading issues of the type\nincluded in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-\nage.

It is true that the art of skill-\nful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the\nselection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-\nket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the\nability of defensive investors generally to get better than average\nresults—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-\nformance.* (Our skepticism extends to the management of large\nfunds by experts.)\nLet us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem\nto prove the opposite.

The defensive\ninvestor must confine himself to the shares of important companies\nwith a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial\ncondition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such\ntraded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-\nnies account for most of the total value of the index, the return of the\nWilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500.

Aggressive investors may buy other types of common\nstocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-\nlished by intelligent analysis.\nToconclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-\ntary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the\npurchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an\nalternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might\nalso utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled\nfunds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,\nif his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-\nment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration\nof his investment program along standard lines. The third is the\ndevice of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the\npractitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars\neach month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when\nthe market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up\nwith a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-\ning, this method is an application of a broader approach known as\n“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-\ngestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks\nbetween the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-\ntionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the\ndefensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later\nchapters.*\nResults to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor\nOur enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and\nexpect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive\ncompanion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be\nworse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,\nand native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead\nof profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,\nbecome indistinguishable from handicaps.

The stocks selected are likely to be among those\nwhich have been “behaving” better than the market average. A\nsmall number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.\nHere they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the\nestablished mechanism of the stock exchanges.

Long-term selectivity. Here the usual emphasis is on an\nexcellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-\ntinue in the future.

He may be wrong in his esti-\nmate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price\nmay already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of\nnear-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are\ngenerally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to\nthe extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-\nered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of\nthis year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for\nnext year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for\nthe same reason.\nIn choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor’s\nhandicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error\nin the prediction—which we illustrated by our airlines example on\np. 6—is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-\nings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is\ntheoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making\ncorrect predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect\nones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors\ncould count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-\nfessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term\nfuture earnings?\nWeare thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-\nsion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average\nresults, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently\nsound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.\nAre there any such policies available for the enterprising\ninvestor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there\nare broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in\npractice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-\nments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-\neral market and at all times in at least some of the individual\nissues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because\nof lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice.

Thus it seems that any intelli-\ngent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable\npicnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness. So it\nseems, but somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neg-\nlected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves\na protracted and patience-trying experience. And selling short a\ntoo popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not\nonly of one’s courage and stamina but also of the depth of one’s\npocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is\nnot impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.\nThere is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which\nover many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return\nof 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew\ntheir way around in this field. They include intersecurity arbi-\ntrages, payouts or workouts in liquidations, protected hedges of\ncertain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-\nsition which offers a substantially higher value for certain shares\nthan their price on the date of the announcement. The number of\nsuch deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have\nbeen a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti. But with the\nmultiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of\nobstacles to mergers and of deals that didn’t go through; quite a\nfew individual losses were thus realized in these once-reliable\noperations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished\nby too much competition.†\n*In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that its share\nprice will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-\nrow shares from someone who owns them; then you immediately sell the\nborrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the\nstock drops, you will be able to buy your replacement shares at a lower\nprice. The difference between the price at which you sold your borrowed\nshares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit\n(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs).

In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-\ntuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula—\nbased on earnings and current interest rates—for determining a\nlevel to buy the DJIA below its “central” or “intrinsic” value,\nand to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-\nerning maxim of the Rothschilds: “Buy cheap and sell dear.”* And\nit had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained\nand pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought\nbecause they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.\nAlas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. Asecond illustra-\ntion is provided by the famous “Dow Theory” of stock-market\nmovements, in a comparison of its indicated splendid results for\n1897–1933 and its much more questionable performance since\n1934.\nA third and final example of the golden opportunities not\nrecently available: A good part of our own operations on Wall\nStreet had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issueseas-\nily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than\ntheir share in the net current assets (working capital) alone, not\ncounting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all\nliabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling\nat a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-\nness. No proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what\nhe owned at so ridiculously low a figure. Strangely enough, such\nerrors in pricing these complex deals. They became so good at it that the\neasy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down.\nAlthough Graham does discuss it again (see pp. 174–175), this sort of trad-\ning is no longer feasible or appropriate for most people, since only multi-\nmillion-dollar trades are large enough to generate worthwhile profits.\nWealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge\nfunds that specialize in merger or “event” arbitrage.\n*The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the dominant\npower in European investment banking and brokerage in the nineteenth\ncentury.

A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price\nbecause somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once\nput it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of\nvalue,” while speculators “base [their] standards of value upon the\nmarket price.”2For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes\nis like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham\ncalled “quotational” values matter much less. Graham urges you to\ninvest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had\nno way of knowing its daily share price.3\nLike casino gambling or betting on the horses, speculating in the\nmarket can be exciting or even rewarding (if you happen to get lucky).\nBut it’s the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That’s because\nWall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds\nso that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who\ntries to beat the house at its own speculative game.\nOn the other hand, investingis a unique kind of casino—one where\nyou cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that\nput the odds squarely in your favor. People who investmake money for\nthemselves; people who speculatemake money for their brokers. And\nthat, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable\nvirtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.\nUNSAFE AT HIGH SPEED\nConfusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a\nmistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction.

To reach your long-term financial goals,\nyou must be sustainably and reliably right. The techniques that\nbecame so trendy in the 1990s—day trading, ignoring diversification,\nflipping hot mutual funds, following stock-picking “systems”—seemed\nto work. But they had no chance of prevailing in the long run, because\nthey failed to meet all three of Graham’s criteria for investing.\nTo see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine\nthat two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed\nlimit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I\ncan get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”?

By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%—a holding period of\nonly 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a\nstock for nearly three years; by 2002, that ownership period had\nshrunk to just 10.9 months. It’s as if mutual-fund managers were\nstudying their stocks just long enough to learn they shouldn’t have\nbought them in the first place, then promptly dumping them and start-\ning all over.\nEven the most respected money-management firms got antsy. In\nearly 1995, Jeffrey Vinik, manager of Fidelity Magellan (then the\nworld’s largest mutual fund), had 42.5% of its assets in technology\nstocks. Vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders “have invested\nin the fund for goals that are years away....I think their objectives are\nthe same as mine, and that they believe, as I do, that a long-term\napproach is best.” But six months after he wrote those high-minded\nwords, Vinik sold off almost all his technology shares, unloading nearly\n$19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks.

First of all, many investors sell\ntheir crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can\ncut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow\nmore cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve\ntheir outperformance (or minimize their underperformance).

In 2000 alone, the four Foolish\nstocks—Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, SBC, and General Motors—\nlost 14% while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%.\nAs these examples show, there’s only one thing that never suffers a\nbear market on Wall Street: dopey ideas. Each of these so-called\ninvesting approaches fell prey to Graham’s Law. All mechanical formu-\nlas for earning higher stock performance are “a kind of self-destructive\nprocess—akin to the law of diminishing returns.” There are two reasons\nthe returns fade away. If the formula was just based on random statis-\ntical flukes (like The Foolish Four), the mere passage of time will\nexpose that it made no sense in the first place. On the other hand, if\nthe formula actually did work in the past (like the January effect), then\nby publicizing it, market pundits always erode—and usually eliminate—\nits ability to do so in the future.\nAll this reinforces Graham’s warning that you must treat specula-\ntion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:\n• You must never delude yourself into thinking that you’re investing\nwhen you’re speculating.\n• Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin\nto take it seriously.\n• You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.\nJust as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor\nand leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room,\nthe intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as\na “mad money” account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is\nthe maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Nevermin-\ngle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your invest-\nment accounts; neverallow your speculative thinking to spill over into\nyour investing activities; and neverput more than 10% of your assets\ninto your mad money account, no matter what happens.\nFor better or worse, the gambling instinct is part of human nature—\nso it’s futile for most people even to try suppressing it.

The shrinkage in the purchasing\npower of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope\nby speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has\ngreatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those\nwith a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living\nadvances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-\npal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a\nloss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in\ntheir dividends and the prices of their shares.\nOn the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities\nhave concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form\nof investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by their\nvery nature more desirable investments than bonds. We have\nheard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios\nshould consist 100% of stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is\nquite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were\n*By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a foundation\nor endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had spread to indi-\nvidual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994 edition of his influ-\nential book, Stocks for the Long Run,finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the\nWharton School recommended that “risk-taking” investors should buy on\nmargin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their\nassets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February\n1999, the Honorable Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the\naudience at an investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for any-\none to have any money in a bond fund.”\nwww.fx1618.com\n47",

Astatement of this kind would be as\nabsurd as was the contrary one—too often heard years ago—that\nany bond is safer than any stock. In this chapter we shall try to\napply various measurements to the inflation factor, in order to\nreach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may\nwisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the\nprice level.\nIn this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our\nviews of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-\ntion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it\nhas taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-\ntions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them\nin confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a\ncondensed historical tabulation that contains much information\nabout changes in the general price level and concomitant changes\nin the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures\nwill begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-\nyear intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of\nwartime price controls.)\nThe first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the\npast—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and\n1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with\nthe advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have\nhad three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at\nvarying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor\nshould clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent\ninflation to come.\nCan we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear\nanswer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It\nwould seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-\nsistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the\nconsumer price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for\n1965–1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%. Official govern-\nwww.fx1618.com",

(This would compare with an annual rate of\nabout 21⁄% for the entire period 1915–1970.)1\n2\nWhat would be the implications of such an advance? It would\neat up, in higher living costs, about one-half the income now\nobtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed\nafter-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would\nbe a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would\nnot mean that the true value, or the purchasing power, of the\ninvestor’s fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half\nhis interest income after taxes he would maintain this buying\npower intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.\nBut the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reason-\nably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than\nhigh-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered\nin 1970–1971?” Would not, for example, an all-stock program be\npreferable to a part-bond, part-stock program? Do not common\nstocks have a built-in protection against inflation, and are they not\nalmost certain to give a better return over the years than will\nbonds? Have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than\nhave bonds over the 55-year period of our study?\nThe answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Com-\nmon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period\nof time in the past. The rise of the DJIAfrom an average of 77 in\n1915 to an average of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual com-\npounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%\nfor average dividend return.

But they do not exceed that\nnowoffered by high-grade bonds. This brings us to the next logical\nquestion: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common\nstocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in\nthe last five and one-half decades?\nOur answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common\nstocksmaydo better in the future than in the past, but they are far\nfrom certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time\nelements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to\noccur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second\napplies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially\nand psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five\nyears or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his\nsatisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-\nsions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of\na lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year\nto year.\nOn this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-\nnection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the\nmovement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious\nexample is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-\ning was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But\nboth stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since\n1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the\nrecord of previous five-year periods.\nInflation and Corporate Earnings\nAnother and highly important approach to the subject is by a\nstudy of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.\nThis has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic\nactivity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with\nwholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen\nrather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of\nthe period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of\nmore liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-\nies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on\nmuch above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIAgroup—\nwww.fx1618.com",

(This relation-\n4\nship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,”\nmanner—e.g., that the DJIAprice of 900 equals 18 times the actual\nearnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)\nOur figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous\nchapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return\nof about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-\ntion of, say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note\nthat each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase\nthe market price by about $1.60.)\nThe reader will object that in the end our calculations make no\nallowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to\nresult from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is\nthe absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount\nin the past has had any directeffect on reported per-share earnings.\nThe cold figures demonstrate that allthe large gain in the earnings\nof the DJIAunit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately\nlarge growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If\ninflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect\nwould have been to increase the “value” of previously existing\ncapital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old\ncapital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. But\nnothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during\nwhich the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40%. (Busi-\nness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than\nby “consumer prices.”) The only way that inflation can add to\ncommon stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on cap-\nital investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been\nthe case.\nIn the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-\nnied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices.

The 1970 ratio must\nhave been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a signifi-\ncant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a whole\nis accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing\n4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the\ndebt ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have\nfallen still lower, in spite of the inflation.\nThe stock market has considered that the public-utility enter-\nprises have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a\ngreat advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of\nraising the rates charged under the regulatory process. But this\nmay be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of\nelectricity, gas, and telephone services have advanced so much less\nthan the general price index puts these companies in a strong\nstrategic position for the future.3They are entitled by law to charge\nrates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital, and\nthis will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has\nin the inflations of the past.\nAll of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the\ninvestor has no sound basis for expecting more than an average\noverall return of, say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common\nstocks purchased at the late 1971 price level.

Somehow it is\nhard to think of paying $67,500 for a U.S. silver dollar dated 1804\n(but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.”4We\nacknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our\nreaders will find the swimming safe and easy there.\nThe outright ownership of real estate has long been considered\nas a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount\nof protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are\nalso subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in\nlocation, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles.\nFinally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate\nmeans, except by various types of participations with others and\nwith the special hazards that attach to new flotations—not too dif-\nferent from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All\nwe should say to the investor is, “Be sure it’s yours before you go\ninto it.”\nConclusion\nNaturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous\nchapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor\ncannot afford to put all his funds into one basket—neither in the\nbond basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds\nhave recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect\nof continuing inflation.\nThe more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income\ntherefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the\nin a year—that it can, all by itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter-\ning. However, the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its\nhigh storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual\nfund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging\nbelow 1% in annual expenses.

Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical\nposition—2% worse off after inflation. So long as the nominal (or\nabsolute) change is positive, we view it as a good thing—even if the\nreal (or after-inflation) result is negative. And any change in your own\nsalary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices\nin the economy as a whole.3Likewise, investors were delighted to earn\n11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly\ndisappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003—even though\nthey were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up\nwith inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank’s\nads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel\ngood. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of\ntaking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation\nis so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your\ninvesting success not just by what you make, but by how much you\nkeep after inflation.\nMore basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard\nagainst whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three\ngood reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:\n• As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one\nof the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured\nby the Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over\nthat period, rising at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979\nalone, inflation raged at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what\nbecame known as “stagflation”—and leading many commentators\nto question whether America could compete in the global market-\n3For more insights into this behavioral pitfall, see Eldar Shafir, Peter Dia-\nmond, and Amos Tversky, “Money Illusion,” in Daniel Kahneman and Amos\nTversky, eds., Choices, Values, and Frames (Cambridge University Press,\n2000), pp. 335–355.\nwww.fx1618.com",

No one who lived through it would scoff\nat such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to\nprotect against the risk that it might recur.\n• Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have\nsuffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized\nrate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods\ndestroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power.5Wewould be\ncrazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a\ndisaster. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it can\nnever happen here.6\n• Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars\nthat have been cheapened by inflation. Completely eradicating\ninflation runs against the economic self-interest of any govern-\nment that regularly borrows money.7\n4That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous “malaise” speech, in\nwhich he warned of “a crisis in confidence” that “strikes at the very heart\nand soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to destroy the social\nand the political fabric of America.”\n5See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, “Modern Hyper-\nand High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper\n8930, at www.nber.org/papers/w8930.\n6In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the\nAmerican Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through\n1779, with a pound of butter costing $12 and a barrel of flour fetching\nnearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-\ntion raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and nearly 200% (in the\nConfederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.\n7I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,\nbut accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or steadily falling\nprices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower—which is why\nmost investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds,\nas a form of insurance against deflating prices.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which\ninflation exceeded 6%; the average return for those 14 years was a\nmeasly 2.6%.\nWhile mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs\nof their own raw materials on to customers, high inflation wreaks\nhavoc—forcing customers to slash their purchases and depressing\nactivity throughout the economy.\nThe historical evidence is clear: Since the advent of accurate\nstock-market data in 1926, there have been 64 five-year periods\n(i.e., 1926–1930, 1927–1931, 1928–1932, and so on through\n1998–2002). In 50 of those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time),\nstocks outpaced inflation.9 That’s impressive, but imperfect; it means\nthat stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.\n8When inflation is negative, it is technically termed “deflation.” Regularly\nfalling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think of the Japanese\nexample. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989, with real estate\nand the stock market dropping in value year after year—a relentless water\ntorture for the world’s second-largest economy.\n9Ibbotson Associates, Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation, 2003 Handbook\n(Ibbotson Associates, Chicago, 2003), Table 2-8.

Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters\nhave become widely available to investors:\nREITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced\n“reets”), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial\nand residential properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds,\nREITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van-\nguard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include\nCohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund,\nand Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is\nunlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give\nyou some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without\nhampering your overall returns.\nTIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S.\ngovernment bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in\nvalue when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the\nUnited States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from\nthe risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran-\ntee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In\none easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the\nloss of purchasing power.12\nThere is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond\nrises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that\nincrease in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper\n10Thorough, if sometimes outdated, information on REITs can be found at\nwww.nareit.com.\n11For further information, see www.vanguard.com, www.cohenandsteers.\ncom, www.columbiafunds.com, and www.fidelity.com.

The sec-\nond is the even more celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (the\nDJIA, or “the Dow”), which dates back to 1897; it contains 30 com-\npanies, of which one is American Telephone & Telegraph and the\nother 29 are large industrial enterprises.1\nChart I, presented by courtesy of Standard & Poor’s, depicts the\nmarket fluctuations of its 425-industrial-stock index from 1900\nthrough 1970. (A corresponding chart available for the DJIA will\nlook very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct\npatterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs\nfrom 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather\nsimilar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual\nadvance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the\n“New Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible after-\nmath of collapse, followed by quite irregular fluctuations until\n1949. Comparing the average level of 1949 with that of 1924, we\nfind the annual rate of advance to be a mere 11⁄%; hence the close of\n2\nour second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for\ncommon stocks. By the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the\nbeginning of the greatest bull market in our history, presented in\nthe last third of our chart. This phenomenon may have reached its\nculmination in December 1968 at 118 for Standard & Poor’s 425\nindustrials (and 108 for its 500-stock composite). As Table 3-1\nshows, there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968\n(especially in 1956–57 and 1961–62), but the recoveries therefrom\nwere so rapid that they had to be denominated (in the long-\naccepted semantics) as recessions in a single bull market, rather\nthan as separate market cycles. Between the low level of 162 for\n“the Dow” in mid-1949 and the high of 995 in early 1966, the\nadvance had been more than sixfold in 17 years—which is at the\naverage compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends\nof, say, 31⁄% per annum.

Few people seem to have\nbeen bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might\nindicate that it had been overdone. The subsequent decline from the\n1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the Standard & Poor’s com-\nposite (and 37% for the DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in\n1939–1942, which had reflected the perils and uncertainties after\nPearl Harbor. In the dramatic manner so characteristic of Wall\nStreet, the low level of May 1970 was followed by a massive and\nspeedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of a new\nall-time high for the Standard & Poor’s industrials in early 1972.\nThe annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out\nat about 9% for the S & Pcomposite (or the industrial index), using\nthe average figures for both years. That rate of climb was, of course,\nmuch greater than for any similar period before 1950. (But in the last\ndecade the rate of advance was much lower—51⁄% for the S & P\n4\ncomposite index and only the once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)\nThe record of price movements should be supplemented by cor-\nresponding figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide\nan overall view of what has happened to our share economy over\nthe ten decades. We present a conspectus of this kind in our Table\n3-2 (p. 71). It is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study\nall these figures with care, but for some we hope they will be inter-\nesting and instructive.\nLet us comment on them as follows: The full decade figures\nsmooth out the year-to-year fluctuations and leave a general pic-\nture of persistent growth. Only two of the nine decades after the\nfirst show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 1891–1900\nand 1931–1940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver-\nage dividends. But the rates of growth in all three categories are\nquite variable. In general the performance since World War II has\nbeen superior to that of earlier decades, but the advance in the\n1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s.

The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in\nthe overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit\non invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World\nWar years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number\nof companies reported net losses for the year; many became “finan-\ncially troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were\nquite a few important bankruptcy proceedings. These facts as\nmuch as any others have prompted the statement made above*\nthat the great boom era may have come to an end in 1969–1970.\nAstriking feature of Table 3-2 is the change in the price/earn-\nings ratios since World War II.† In June 1949 the S & P composite\nindex sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12\nmonths; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi-\ndend yield on the S & Pindex had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to\nonly 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest\nrates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to\n4.50%. This is certainly the most remarkable turnabout in the\npublic’s attitude in all stock-market history.\nTo people of long experience and innate caution the passage\nfrom one extreme to another carried a strong warning of trou-\nble ahead. They could not help thinking apprehensively of the\n1926–1929 bull market and its tragic aftermath. But these fears have\nnot been confirmed by the event. True, the closing price of the DJIA\n*See pp. 50–52.\n†The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like the S & P\n500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the market’s temperature. If, for\ninstance, a company earned $1 per share of net income over the past year,\nand its stock is selling at $8.93 per share, its price/earnings ratio would be\n8.93; if, however, the stock is selling at $69.70, then the price/earnings ratio\nwould be 69.7. In general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is\nconsidered low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater\nthan 20 is considered expensive.

But nothing has happened either\nto business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar-\nket and depression of 1929–1932.\nThe Stock-Market Level in Early 1972\nWith a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and\ndividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions\nabout the level of 900 for the DJIAand 100 for the S & Pcomposite\nindex in January 1972.\nIn each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the\nstock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the\nquestion whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The\nreader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached\non these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-\npunishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the\nvarious stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also\na taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries\nto reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-\nels. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959\nanalyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:\nIn 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones\nlevel of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that\n“it was not too high in relation to underlying values.” When we\napproached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that\nyear had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked\nourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the\nlevel of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high\nfor sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular\nadvance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no\nmeans easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-\ntiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that\n“from the standpoint of value indications—our chief investment\nguide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”\nBut we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages\nhad advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the\nwww.fx1618.com",

Setting these\nfactors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-\ntious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-\nularly brilliant counsel. Agood prophet would have foreseen that\nthe market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the\nnext five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if\nany of those whose business was stock-market forecasting—as\nours was not—had any better inkling than we did of what lay\nahead.\nAt the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIAat an all-time high\nof 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be\nsummarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):\n“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-\nent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous\nbecause prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the\ncase the market’s momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to\nunjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the\nfuture in which there will never be any serious losses, and in\nwhich, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock\npurchases.”\nThe caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-\nfied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet\nit was far from fully vindicated. The DJIAadvanced to 685 in 1961;\nthen fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;\nadvanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic\nto 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period\nof six months. At the same time there was a far more serious\nshrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by\nthe striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business\nMachines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in\nJune 1962.\nThis period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched\ncommon stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—\nwhich had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices\nand then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to\nlevels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the\nquotations in just a few months.\nThe collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not\ndisastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps\nwww.fx1618.com",

The stock-market aver-\nages resumed their upward course, producing the following\nsequence:\nStandard & Poor’s\nDJIA 500-Stock Composite\nDecember 1961 735 72.64\nJune 1962 536 52.32\nNovember 1964 892 86.28\nThe recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was\nindeed remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall\nStreet sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had\nappeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to\nthe end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.\nBut at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms\nwas again manifest; nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish\nside, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.\nWe then approached the task of appraising the November 1964\nlevels of the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing\nit learnedly from numerous angles we reached three main con-\nclusions. The first was that “old standards (of valuation) appear\ninapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time.”\nThe second was that the investor “must base his policy on the\nexistence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the\nextremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in\nthe market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the\nother hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni-\ntude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450\"\n(p. 63).

They must weigh\nour reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from\nmost competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end\neach one must make his own decision and accept responsibility\ntherefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to\nwhich course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The\nprinciples of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-\nlowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:\n1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.\n2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.\n3. Areduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring\nit down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The\ncapital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,\nand the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a\nsavings deposit.\nInvestors who for some time have been following a bona fide\ndollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their\nperiodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel\nthe market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather\nstrongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the\nlate 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina\nto pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should\nappear highly unfavorable.\nThis time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA\nadvanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a\nlow of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of\ndebacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines\nrunning as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.\nAnd, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture\nappeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and\ngreater doubts. Asingle fact may summarize the story: The DJIA\nclosed 1970 at a level lower than six years before—the first time\nsuch a thing had happened since 1944.\nwww.fx1618.com",

We con-\nsidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953\n(but too cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584\nfor DJIA), and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments\ncould be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-\nful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in\nfavor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the\none hand, and discouraging endeavors to “beat the market” or to\n“pick the winners” on the other.\nNonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from\na renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time\nas of late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more inter-\nesting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.\nThere is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s Ethicsthat\ngoes: “It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of\nexactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is\nequally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a\nmathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an ora-\ntor.” The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle\nbetween that of a mathematician and of an orator.\nAt various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood\nat the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-\nous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to\nuse the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor’s\ncomposite index (or S & P500), because it is more comprehensive\nand representative of the general market than the 30-stock DJIA.\nWe shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four\ndates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,\n1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take\nthe convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times\nin 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.\nFor our earnings figures we present both the last year’s showing\nand the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use\nthe last twelve months’ figures; and for 1971 bond interest and\nwholesale prices those of August 1971.\nThe 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in\nOctober 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968.

      "text": "78 The Intelligent Investor\nmarket. This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-\nstrued to indicate that the market was especially high in January\n1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought\ninto the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The\nreader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-\nings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire\nperiod, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,\nby this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When\ndividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the\nrelationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. In\nthe early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds\nyield twice as much, and more, than stocks.\nOur final judgment is that the adverse change in the bond-\nyield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio\nfor late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view\nof the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was\nsome 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-\npoint of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the\n1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)\nIn terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still\nappear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-\nfered in 1969–1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a\nnew stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in\n1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during\n1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of\nlow-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too\nearly (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.\nHence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is\nlacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November\n1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-\nlook would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the\n900 DJIAlevel before the next serious setback or collapse. But we\ncannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,\nthe early-1971-market’s disregard of the harrowing experiences of\nless than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness\ngo unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-\ncult times ahead—perhaps in the form of a fairly quick replay of\nthe the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-\nmarket fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3\nwww.fx1618.com",

He looks\ntwo years ahead, foreseeing the “catastrophic” bear market of\n1973–1974, in which U.S. stocks lost 37% of their value.1 He also\nlooks more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of\nmarket gurus and best-selling books that were not even on the horizon\nin his lifetime.\nThe heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must\nnever forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortu-\nnately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in\nthe 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance pro-\nfessor Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (1994)—culminating,\nin a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett’s Dow\n36,000, David Elias’ Dow 40,000, and Charles Kadlec’s Dow\n100,000 (all published in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had\nreturned an annual average of 7% after inflation ever since 1802.\nTherefore, they concluded, that’s what investors should expect in the\nfuture.\nSome bulls went further. Since stocks had “always” beaten bonds\nover any period of at least 30 years, stocks must be less risky than\nbonds or even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of\nowning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why\n1If dividewndws awre. nfoxt1 in6cl1ud8ed.c, sotomcks fell 47.8% in those two years.\n80",

It’s big.”\n• On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist\nat the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal: “It’s a\nnew world order. We see people discard all the right companies\nwith all the right people with the right vision because their stock\nprice is too high—that’s the worst mistake an investor can make.”\n• In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Apple-\ngate, then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers,\nasked rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two\nyears ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.”\nBut the answer is yes.It always has been. It always will be.\nAnd when Graham asked, “Can such heedlessness go unpun-\nished?” he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no.Like an\nenraged Greek god, the stock market crushed everyone who had\ncome to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some\nkind of divine right. Just look at how those forecasts by Landis,\nFroelich, and Applegate held up:\n• From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis’s pet wire-\nless stocks, Nokia, lost “only” 67%—while the worst, Winstar\nCommunications, lost 99.9%.\n• Froelich’s favorite stocks—Cisco Systems and Motorola—fell more\nthan 70% by late 2002. Investors lost over $400 billion on Cisco\nalone—more than the annual economic output of Hong Kong,\nIsrael, Kuwait, and Singapore combined.\n• In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the\nDow Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite\nIndex was at 4446.

      "text": "SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST\nThere was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have “always”\nbeaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do\nnot exist. The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market’s\nearliest returns contain as few as seven (yes, 7!) stocks.1 By\n1800, however, there were some 300 companies in America\n(many in the Jeffersonian equivalents of the Internet: wooden\nturnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and their investors\nlost their knickers.\nBut the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went\nbust in those early years, a problem technically known as “sur-\nvivorship bias.” Thus these indexes wildly overstate the results\nearned by real-life investors—who lacked the 20/20 hindsight\nnecessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy. A lonely\nhandful of companies, including Bank of New York and J. P. Mor-\ngan Chase, have prospered continuously since the 1790s. But\nfor every such miraculous survivor, there were thousands of\nfinancial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Penn-\nsylvania Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers’s Gap Turn-\npike Co.—all omitted from the “historical” stock indexes.\nJeremy Siegel’s data show that, after inflation, from 1802\nthrough 1870 stocks gained 7.0% per year, bonds 4.8%, and\ncash 5.1%. But Elroy Dimson and his colleagues at London\nBusiness School estimate that the pre-1871 stock returns are\noverstated by at least two percentage points per year.2 In the\nreal world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds—and\nperhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term\nrecord “proves” that stocks are guaranteed to outperform\nbonds or cash is an ignoramus.\n1By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan-\ncial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the\nrambunctious young American stock market.\n2See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time,May 6, 2002,\np. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between 1871 and\nthe 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds of automobile,\naviation, and radio companies that went bust without a trace. These returns,\ntoo, are probably overstated by one to two percentage points.\nwww.fx1618.com",

      "text": "Commentary on Chapter 3 83\nTHE HIGHER THEY GO,\nTHE HARDER THEY FALL\nAs the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham\nurges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.\nWhy should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their\npast returns? When every investor comes to believe that stocks are\nguaranteed to make money in the long run, won’t the market end up\nbeing wildly overpriced? And once that happens, how can future\nreturns possibly be high?\nGraham’s answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common\nsense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function\nof the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering\naway, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the\nworld was at peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean—\nthat stocks were worth buying at any price.Since the profits that com-\npanies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to\npay for stocks must also be finite.\nThink of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the great-\nest basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Sta-\ndium like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by\npaying Jordan up to $34 million a year to bounce a big leather ball\naround a wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have\nbeen justified paying him $340 million, or $3.4 billion, or $34 billion,\nper season.\nTHE LIMITS OF OPTIMISM\nFocusing on the market’s recent returns when they have been rosy,\nwarns Graham, will lead to “a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion\nthat equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks\nin the future.” From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least\n20% each year—a surge unprecedented in American history—stock\nbuyers became ever more optimistic:\n• In mid-1998, investors surveyed by the Gallup Organization for\nthe PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn\nan average of roughly 13% over the year to come.

In 2001, for instance, SBC\nCommunications raised the projected return on its pension plan\nfrom 8.5% to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return\non the pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock index had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.\nA quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:\n• Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of\none-year returns on stocks had slumped to 7%—even though\ninvestors could now buy at prices nearly 50% lower than in\n2000.2\n• Those gung-ho assumptions about the returns on their pension\nplans will cost the companies in the S & P 500 a bare minimum of\n$32 billion between 2002 and 2004, according to recent Wall\nStreet estimates.\nEven though investors all know they’re supposed to buy low and\nsell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s\nwarning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more\nenthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,\nthe more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run. On\nMarch 24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at\n$14.75 trillion.

Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bear-\nish, predicting flat or even negative market returns for years—even\ndecades—to come.\nAt this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering\nhow calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed\non something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe\nthem now?\n2Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’ expec-\ntation of a 7% stock return will be realized.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The stock market’s performance depends on three factors:\n• real growth (the rise of companies’ earnings and dividends)\n• inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the\neconomy)\n• speculative growth—or decline (any increase or decrease in the\ninvesting public’s appetite for stocks)\nIn the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share\nhas averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).3 As of early 2003,\ninflation was running around 2.4% annually; the dividend yield on\nstocks was 1.9%. So,\n1.5% to 2%\n+ 2.4%\n+ 1.9%\n= 5.8% to 6.3%\nIn the long run, that means you can reasonably expect stocks to\naverage roughly a 6% return (or 4% after inflation). If the investing\npublic gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that\nspeculative fever will temporarily drive returns higher. If, instead,\ninvestors are full of fear, as they were in the 1930s and 1970s, the\nreturns on stocks will go temporarily lower. (That’s where we are in\n2003.)\nRobert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham\ninspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index against average corporate\nprofits over the past 10 years (after inflation).

I think Graham,\never the conservative, would split the difference between the lowest\nand highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks\nwill earn roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that\nprojection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added\ntogether real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.)\nCompared to the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it’s a whisker better\nthan the gains that bonds are likely to produce—and reason enough for\nmost investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.\nBut there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing\nyou can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that\nyou will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that\nthe past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always!\nAnd the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will\nmost brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their\nviews about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecast-\ning powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a\nview of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.\nSo, by all means, you should lower your expectations—but take care\nnot to depress your spirit.

At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance\ncompanies, and so-called legal trust funds. Ageneration ago their\ninvestments were limited by law in many states to high-grade\nbonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other\nextreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,\nwho will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-\nvided he considers it an attractive purchase.\nIt has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot\nafford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return\non their invested funds. From this there has developed the general\nnotion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is\nmore or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.\nOur view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-\ndent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-\ning and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes\nto our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from\nconcern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and\nenterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and\nskill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be less real risk\nassociated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the chance of a\nlarge profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about\n41⁄%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-\n2\npected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bonds\nlost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in\ninterest rates.\nwww.fx1618.com\n88",

There is an implication here that\nthe standard division should be an equal one, or 50–50, between\nthe two major investment mediums. According to tradition the\nsound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks\nwould be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a\nprotracted bear market.

Their selling activities have\nbeen largely related to endeavors to switch from less to more\npromising holdings.\nIf, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact\nwith its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established,\nthen we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce\nhis common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild\nthem later to the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the\ninvestor should not have more than one-half in equities unless he\nhas strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is\nsure that he could view a market decline of the 1969–70 type with\nequanimity. It is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can\nbe justified at the levels existing in early 1972. Thus we would\ncounsel against a greater than 50% apportionment to common\nstocks at this time. But, for complementary reasons, it is almost\nequally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%,\nunless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current\nmarket level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in\nany further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.\nWeare thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may\nappear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the\nguiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi-\nsion between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the mar-\nket level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%,\nthe balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock\nportfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a\nfall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use\nof one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.\nYale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number\nof years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% “normal hold-\ning” in common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to\nhave given up its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its\nportfolio in equities (including some convertibles). (At that time\nthe endowment funds of 71 such institutions, totaling $7.6 billion,\nheld 60.3% in common stocks.)

The much larger income return now\noffered by good bonds than by representative stocks is a potent\nargument for favoring the bond component. The investor’s choice\nbetween 50% or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on\nhis own temperament and attitude.

In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturi-\nties was between obtaining, say, 71⁄% on “grade Aa” corporate\n2\nbonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term “municipals” is\ngenerally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including\nstate obligations.) There was thus for this maturity a loss in income\nof some 30% in passing from the corporate to the municipal field.\nHence if the investor was in a maximum tax bracket higher than\n30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic-\nipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A\nsingle person starts paying a 30% rate when his income after\ndeductions passes $10,000; for a married couple the rate applies\nwhen combined taxable income passes $20,000. It is evident that a\nlarge proportion of individual investors would obtain a higher\nreturn after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate\nbonds.\nThe choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a\ndifferent question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself\nagainst a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a\nlower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable\ngainin principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in\nChapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.\nFor a period of many years in the past the only sensible bond\npurchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety\nwas—and is—unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other\nbond investments of first quality; they had a money-back option\nand other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In\nour earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled “U.S. Savings\nBonds: ABoon to Investors.”\nAs we shall point out, U.S. savings bonds still possess certain\nunique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ-\nual investor. For the man of modest capital—with, say, not more\nthan $10,000 to put into bonds—we think they are still the easiest\nand the best choice. But those with larger funds may find other\nmediums more desirable.\nLet us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con-\nsideration, and discuss them briefly with respect to general\ndescription, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and\nother features.\nwww.fx1618.com",

In the typical case bonds were\ncallable fairly soon after issuance, and at modest premiums—say\n5%—above the issue price. This meant that during a period of wide\nfluctuations in the underlying interest rates the investor had to\nbear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all\nbut a meager participation in favorable ones.\nExample: Our standard example has been the issue of American\nGas & Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101 in\n1928. Four years later, under near-panic conditions, the price of\nthese good bonds fell to 621⁄, yielding 8%.

Similarly, there is an advantage\nin buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-\ncoupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years.

Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,\nbut they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an\ninherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent\nfor his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-\ndends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-\nted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for\nthe directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless\nthey also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-\nferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the\nfixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal\nclaim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of\na common shareholder (or partner).\nThese weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend\nto come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a\nsmall percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched\nas to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-\nsitudes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is\nwhen their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At\nsuch times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but\ntoo unconventional for the defensive investor.)\nIn other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not\nat all.

Corporations pay income\ntax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the\nfull amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-\nrate rate is 48%, this means that $100 received as preferred-stock\ndividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-\nest is taxed $48. On the other hand, individual investors pay\nexactly the same tax on preferred-stock investments as on bond\ninterest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,\nall investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-\nrations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors\nwho pay income tax.*\nSecurity Forms\nThe bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto dis-\ncussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. Abond-\nholder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal\non a definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a\nfixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-\nmon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-\nified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He\nmay or may not have a vote.)\nThe above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the\nmajority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable\ndepartures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible\nand similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest\ndoes not have to be paid unless it is earned by the company.\n(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-\nings, but the period is often limited to three years.)\nIncome bonds should be used by corporations much more\n*While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed. Corpora-\ntions can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from dividends,\nand the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a corporation would pay\nroughly $24.50 in tax on $100 in dividends from preferred stock versus\n$35 in tax on $100 in interest income.

But the form itself has sev-\neral practical advantages, especially in comparison with and in\nsubstitution for the numerous (convertible) preferred-stock issues\nof recent years.

(Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-\nods—creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly passive, or\nvice versa.)\nBoth approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful\nwith either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right\none, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep\nyour costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction between\nactive and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial\nrisk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in our\ninvestments—but also within ourselves.\nCAN YOU BE BRAVE, OR WILL YOU CAVE?\nHow, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most\nbasic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in\nbonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discus-\nsion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge\nthat inflation is one of your worst enemies.)\nThe most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allo-\ncate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions\nthe word “age.” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-\nventional wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you ought\nto take depends mainly on how old you are.2A traditional rule of thumb\nwas to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your\nassets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old would\nput 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%\nthere.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the\nlate 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were younger\nthan 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had\nonly a “moderate” tolerance for risk!3\n2A recent Google search for the phrase “age and asset allocation” turned\nup more than 30,000 online references.\n3James K.

Why should your age determine how much risk you can take?\nAn 89-year-old with $3 million, an ample pension, and a gaggle of\ngrandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds.\nShe already has plenty of income, and her grandchildren (who will\neventually inherit her stocks) have decades of investing ahead of\nthem. On the other hand, a 25-year-old who is saving for his wedding\nand a house down payment would be out of his mind to put all his\nmoney in stocks. If the stock market takes an Acapulco high dive, he\nwill have no bond income to cover his downside—or his backside.\nWhat’s more, no matter how young you are, you might suddenly\nneed to yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now, but 40\nminutes from now. Without a whiff of warning, you could lose your job,\nget divorced, become disabled, or suffer who knows what other kind\nof surprise. The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age.

But when you watch every\ndollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime, it’s hard to resist\nbailing out into the “safety” of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and\nholding their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, and\nholding nothing but their own head in their hands. Because so few\ninvestors have the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market, Graham\ninsists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. That\ncushion, he argues, will give you the courage to keep the rest of your\nmoney in stocks even when stocks stink.\nToget a better feel for how much risk you can take, think about the\nfundamental circumstances of your life, when they will kick in, when\nthey might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for cash:\n4For a fascinating essay on this psychological phenomenon, see Daniel\nGilbert and Timothy Wilson’s “Miswanting,” at www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/\nGilbert_&_Wilson(Miswanting).pdf.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Today there is a third: Bonds or\nbond funds?\nTaxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,6 you\nshould buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirement\naccounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the\nhands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your\n401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no current\ntax on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since\ntheir tax advantage goes to waste.7\nShort-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on\nopposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—\nalthough a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the\nother hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-term\nbond will outperform shorter ones.8You can split the difference simply\n6For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people\nearning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than\n$47,450.\n7Two good online calculators that will help you compare the after-tax in-\ncome of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.\ncom/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To\ndecide if a “muni” is right for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” gener-\nated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently\navailable on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or\nwww.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds is\nhigher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any case,\nbe warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and\nmore price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-\nmum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the\nadvantages of municipal bonds.\n8For an excellent introduction to bond investing, see http://flagship.van\nguard.com/web/planret/AdvicePTIBInvestmentsInvestingInBonds.html#Inter\nestRates.

The first was that they had offered a considerable\ndegree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar\ncaused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The\nsecond advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average\nreturn to investors over the years. This was produced both by an\naverage dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and\nby an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the\nyears in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.\nWhile these two advantages have been of major importance—\nand have given common stocks a far better record than bonds\nover the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these\nbenefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price\nfor his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years\nfor the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it\nhad abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stocks\nhave once again, through their high prices, lost their traditional\nadvantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains to\n*The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17\non September 3, 1929.

However, for patient investors who reinvested\ntheir income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,\nsimply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-\ning to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London\nBusiness School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent\nall your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.\nBut if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have\nbeen worth $16,797!

The problem lies there, of\n*Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of\ncontinuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from consideration\nonly one member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average—Microsoft—and\nwould still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500\nindex). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would\nnot be overly restrictive; according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in\nthe S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.\n†The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an\namount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth rate\ninto 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by\n6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its\nearnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1 years).\nwww.fx1618.com",

      "text": "118 The Intelligent Investor\nDollar-Cost Averaging\nThe New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into\npopularizing its “monthly purchase plan,” under which an\ninvestor devotes the same dollar amount each month to buying\none or more common stocks. This is an application of a special type\nof “formula investment” known as dollar-cost averaging. During\nthe predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results\nfrom such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-\ncially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his\nbuying at the wrong times.\nIn Lucile Tomlinson’s comprehensive study of formula invest-\nment plans,1 the author presented a calculation of the results of\ndollar-cost averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow\nJones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-\nchase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test\nshowed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within\nfive years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the\n23 buying periods was 21.5%, exclusive of dividends received.\nNeedless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-\nrary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-\nsion of this ultrasimple investment formula with the striking\nsentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-\ning which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate suc-\ncess, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar\nCost Averaging.”\nIt may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in\nprinciple, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so\nsituated that they can have available for common-stock investment\nthe same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to\nme that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent\nyears. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-\nsary component of a sound savings-investment program. Thus,\nsystematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present\nno more psychological and financial difficulties than similar con-\ntinuous payments for United States savings bonds and for life\ninsurance—to which they should be complementary. The monthly\namount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be\nimpressive and important to the saver.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Let us return to this matter,\nin the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what\nextent should the type of securities selected by the investor vary\nwith his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely\ndifferent conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with\nwhich to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in\nmid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly accretions of\n$10,000; and (3) a young man earning $200 per week and saving\n$1,000 a year.*\nFor the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-\nficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her\ninvestments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally\nbetween United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a\ncompromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-\neral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component\nmay be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-\npared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not\nbuying at too high a level. Assuredly this is not the case in early\n1972.)\nWe do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify\nas an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-\nods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must notdo is\nto take speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.”\nBy this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-\nessary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. It\nwould be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-\ncipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in\npoorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.\nThe prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and\ncompulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the\nsame.

The division of his\nportfolio should then be no different from that of the “typical”\nwidow, and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix-\ning the size of the stock component. The annual savings should be\ninvested in about the same proportions as the total fund.\nThe average doctor may be more likely than the average widow\nto elect to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more\nlikely to succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handi-\ncap, however—the fact that he has less time available to give to his\ninvestment education and to the administration of his funds. In\nfact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-\nrity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample\nconfidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a\ngood return on their money, without the realization that to do so\nsuccessfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and\nsomething of a professional approach to security values.\nFinally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year—and expects to\ndo better gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though\nfor still different reasons.

From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-\nmon stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated\nin the Federal Reserve Board’s survey of 1948. We should like to\npoint out that the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securi-\nties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.\nAbond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or\nprincipal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-\nmon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-\ndend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the\ndividend means that it has proved unsafe. It is also true that an\ninvestment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility that the\nholder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.\nNevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-\nsible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may\nbe of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder\nis unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-\nent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to\na greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior\nissues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a\ntrue risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a\nmortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he\nwere forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not\ntaken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-\nestate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual\npayments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-\nmercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not\nby what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.\nIn Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide\ninvestor does not lose money merely because the market price of\nhis holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does\nwww.fx1618.com",

If a group of well-\nselected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall\nreturn, as measured through a fair number of years, then this\ngroup investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its\nmarket value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell\nfor a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment\n“risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the\nsame time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept\nof risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through\nactual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the\ncompany’s position—or, more frequently perhaps, is the result of\nthe payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth\nof the security.2\nMany common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But\nit is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com-\nmon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that\ntherefore it should not be termed “risky” merely because of the ele-\nment of price fluctuation.

As an old Turkish proverb says,\n“After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.”\nBecause the crash of 2000–2002 was so terrible, many investors\nnow view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of\ncrashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot\nmilk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.\nViewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has\nnothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning\nthem a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to\ngive you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the\nlosses they may have cost you in the recent past.

No matter how\ndefensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance,\nor in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you\nmust keep at least some of your money in stocks.\nFortunately, it’s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy\nstocks.

Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage\nthat professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of\ncommon knowledge.” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,\ntoothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby\nbusiness is always full or that people are still working at a company’s\nheadquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-\nsonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-\nager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime of\nbuying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and\nwhat’s bad, what sells and what doesn’t...and the most important\npart is, you know it before Wall Street knows it.”1\nLynch’s rule—“You can outperform the experts if you use your edge\nby investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t\n1Peter Lynch with John Rothchild, One Up on Wall Street(Penguin, 1989),\np. 23.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The next\nstep is doing the research.” To his credit, Lynch insists that no one\nshould ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or\nhow crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements\nand estimating its business value.\nUnfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.\nBarbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people\nabuse Lynch’s teachings. In 1999 she burbled, “We go to Starbucks\nevery day, so I buy Starbucks stock.” But the Funny Girl forgot that no\nmatter how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to ana-\nlyze Starbucks’s financial statements and make sure the stock isn’t\neven more overpriced than the coffee.

Through specialized online brokerages like www.\nsharebuilder.com, www.foliofn.com, and www.buyandhold.com, you\ncan buy stocks automatically even if you have very little cash to spare.\nThese websites charge as little as $4 for each periodic purchase of\nany of the thousands of U.S. stocks they make available. You can\ninvest every week or every month, reinvest the dividends, and even\ntrickle your money into stocks through electronic withdrawals from\nyour bank account or direct deposit from your paycheck. Sharebuilder\ncharges more to sell than to buy—reminding you, like a little whack\nacross the nose with a rolled-up newspaper, that rapid selling is an\ninvesting no-no—while FolioFN offers an excellent tax-tracking tool.\nUnlike traditional brokers or mutual funds that won’t let you in the door\nfor less than $2,000 or $3,000, these online firms have no minimum\naccount balances and are tailor-made for beginning investors who want\nto put fledgling portfolios on autopilot. To be sure, a transaction fee of\n$4 takes a monstrous 8% bite out of a $50 monthly investment—but if\nthat’s all the money you can spare, then these microinvesting sites are\nthe only game in town for building a diversified portfolio.\nYou can also buy individual stocks straight from the issuing compa-\nnies. In 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission loos-\nened the handcuffs it had long ago clamped onto the direct sale of\nstocks to the public. Hundreds of companies responded by creating\nInternet-based programs allowing investors to buy shares without\ngoing through a broker. Some helpful online sources of information on\nbuying stocks directly include www.dripcentral.com, www.netstock\ndirect.com (an affiliate of Sharebuilder), and www.stockpower.com.\n5According to finance professor Charles Jones of Columbia Business\nSchool, the cost of a small, one-way trade (either a buy or a sell) in a New\nYork Stock Exchange–listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in Graham’s\nday to about 0.25% in 2000. For institutions like mutual funds, those costs\nare actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, “A Century of Stock Market Li-\nquidity anwd wTrawdin.fgx C1o6st1s,”8 at. chtotpm://papers.ssrn.com.)",

If you are not prepared to keep\na permanent and exhaustively detailed record of your purchases, do\nnot buy in the first place. Finally, don’t invest in only one stock—or even\njust a handful of different stocks. Unless you are not willing to spread\nyour bets, you shouldn’t bet at all. Graham’s guideline of owning\nbetween 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors\nwho want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you\nare not overexposed to one industry.6 (For more on how to pick the\nindividual stocks that will make up your portfolio, see pp. 114–115\nand Chapters 11, 14, and 15.)\nIf, after you set up such an online autopilot portfolio, you find your-\nself trading more than twice a year—or spending more than an hour or\ntwo per month, total, on your investments—then something has gone\nbadly wrong.

Index funds are a kind of Rip Van Winkle\ninvestment that is highly unlikely to cause any suffering or surprises\neven if, like Washington Irving’s lazy farmer, you fall asleep for 20\nyears.

By put-\nting every investment decision on autopilot, you drop any self-delusion\nthat you know where stocks are headed, and you take away the\nmarket’s power to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces.\nAs Graham notes, “dollar-cost averaging” enables you to put a fixed\namount of money into an investment at regular intervals. Every week,\nmonth, or calendar quarter, you buy more—whether the markets have\ngone (or are about to go) up, down, or sideways. Any major mutual fund\ncompany or brokerage firm can automatically and safely transfer the\nmoney electronically for you, so you never have to write a check or feel\nthe conscious pang of payment. It’s all out of sight, out of mind.\nThe ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index\nfunds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you\nrenounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going\nbut which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds\nwithin them—will do the best.\nLet’s say you can spare $500 a month. By owning and dollar-cost\naveraging into just three index funds—$300 into one that holds the\ntotal U.S. stock market, $100 into one that holds foreign stocks, and\n$100 into one that holds U.S. bonds—you can ensure that you own\nalmost every investment on the planet that’s worth owning.7 Every\n7For more on the rationale for keeping a portion of your portfolio in foreign\nstocks, sweew ppw. 1.8fx6–116871. 8.com",

There is a difficulty in discussing\nthis topic in orderly fashion, because there is no single or ideal pat-\ntern for aggressive operations. The field of choice is wide; the selec-\ntion should depend not only on the individual’s competence and\nequipment but perhaps equally well upon his interests and prefer-\nences.\nThe most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are\nof a negative sort.

In fact\ncorporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir-\ntually impossible to sell “straight bonds”—i.e., nonconvertibles—\nto the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has\nbeen done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants\nattached), which place them in a separate category. It follows that\nvirtually all the nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent\nolder issues which are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer\nthe possibility of a substantial gain in principal value under favor-\nable future conditions—which would mean here a combination of\nan improved credit rating for the company and lower general\ninterest rates.\n*“High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average interest\nrates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks paying large divi-\ndend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high rates of interest in\norder to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal that it is risky.

For this rea-\nson we shall reprint here our observations on that point made in\nthe 1965 edition, when high-grade bonds yielded only 41⁄%.\n2\nSomething should be said now about investing in second-grade\nissues, which can readily be found to yield any specified return up\nto 8% or more. The main difference between first- and second-\ngrade bonds is usually found in the number of times the interest\ncharges have been covered by earnings. Example: In early 1964\nChicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific 5% income debenture\nbonds, at 68, yielded 7.35%. But the total interest charges of the\nroad, before income taxes, were earned only 1.5 times in 1963,\nagainst our requirement of 5 times for a well-protected railroad\nissue.1\nMany investors buy securities of this kind because they “need\nincome” and cannot get along with the meager return offered by\ntop-grade issues.

For when bad business\ncomes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove highly sus-\nceptible to severe sinking spells; often interest or dividends are\nsuspended or at least endangered, and frequently there is a pro-\nnounced price weakness even though the operating results are not\nat all bad.\nAs a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality\nsenior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten\nrailroad income bondsin 1946–47. These comprise all of those which\nsold at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 1021⁄. By the\n2\nfollowing year the group had registered low prices averaging only\n68, a loss of one-third of the market value in a very short time.\nPeculiarly enough, the railroads of the country were showing\nmuch better earnings in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price\ndecline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of\nthe selloff in the general market. But it should be pointed out that\nthe shrinkage in these income bonds was proportionately larger\nthan that in the common stocks in the Dow Jones industrial list\n(about 23%).

Yet the\nsequel showed all too soon and too plainly that for the minor\nadvantage in annual income the buyer of these second-grade\nbonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal.\nThe above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu-\nlar fallacy that goes under the sobriquet of a “businessman’s\ninvestment.” That involves the purchase of a security showing a\nlarger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying\na correspondingly greater risk.

If you are willing to\nassume some risk you should be certain that you can realize a\nreally substantial gain in principal value if things go well. Hence a\nsecond-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost always a bad\npurchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense—and if you\nare patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.\nSecond-grade bonds and preferred stocks possess two contra-\ndictory attributes which the intelligent investor must bear clearly\nin mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On\nthe other hand, a large proportion recover their position when\nfavorable conditions return, and these ultimately “work out all\nright.” This is true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to\npay dividends for many years. There were a number of such issues\nin the early 1940s, as a consequence of the long depression of the\n1930s. During the postwar boom period of 1945–1947 many of\nthese large accumulations were paid off either in cash or in new\nsecurities, and the principal was often discharged as well. As a\nresult, large profits were made by people who, a few years previ-\nously, had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold\nat low prices.2\nIt may well be true that, in an overall accounting, the higher\nyields obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have\noffset those principal losses that were irrecoverable. In other\nwords, an investor who bought all such issues at their offering\nprices might conceivably fare as well, in the long run, as one who\nlimited himself to first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3\nBut for practical purposes the question is largely irrelevant.\nRegardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full\nprices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines\nprecipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure\nan “average” result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of\nhis larger income to offset or “amortize” those principal losses\nwhich prove to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to\nabstain from buying securities at around 100 if long experience\nindicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next\nweak market.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Our one recommendation is that all investors\nshould be wary of new issues—which means, simply, that these\nshould be subjected to careful examination and unusually severe\ntests before they are purchased.\nThere are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that\nnew issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls\ntherefore for a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that\nmost new issues are sold under “favorable market conditions”—\nwhich means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor-\nable for the buyer.†\nThe effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor-\ntant as we go down the scale from the highest-quality bonds\nthrough second-grade senior issues to common-stock flotations at\nthe bottom. A tremendous amount of financing, consisting of the\nrepayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by\nnew issues with lower coupons, was done in the past. Most of this\nwas in the category of high-grade bonds and preferred stocks. The\nbuyers were largely financial institutions, amply qualified to pro-\ntect their interests. Hence these offerings were carefully priced to\n*New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or IPOs—normally are\nsold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in commission) of 7%. By con-\ntrast, the buyer’s commission on older shares of common stock typically\nranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes roughly twice as much for\nselling something new as it does for selling something old, the new will get\nthe harder sell.\n†Recently, finance professors Owen Lamont of the University of Chicago\nand Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that corpora-\ntions choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near\na peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see Lamont’s “Evaluating\nValue Weighting: Corporate Events and Market Timing” and Schultz’s\n“Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance of IPOs” at http://\npapers.ssrn.com.\nwww.fx1618.com",

As interest rates fell\nlower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for\nthese issues, and many of them later declined appreciably in the\nmarket. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu-\nrities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer;\nbut in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the purchaser\nare likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.\nThe situation proves somewhat different when we study the\nlower-grade bonds and preferred stocks sold during the 1945–46\nand 1960–61 periods. Here the effect of the selling effort is more\napparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with\nindividual and inexpert investors. It was characteristic of these\nofferings that they did not make an adequate showing when\njudged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-\nber of years. They did look safe enough, for the most part, if it\ncould be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without\na serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these\nissues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen\nhad little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers\nto a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-\nment, and one likely to prove costly.\nBull-market periods are usually characterized by the transfor-\nmation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-\npanies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again\nbeginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-\ntions until brought to a catastrophic close in May 1962. After the\nusual “swearing-off” period of several years the whole tragicom-\nedy was repeated, step by step, in 1967–1969.*\n*In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850 com-\npanies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average of more than\none per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again; in 1969 an aston-\nishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped create the bear\nmarkets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that\nonly nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.\nThat undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when\nroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to trigger the over-\nwww.fx1618.com",

      "text": "Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 141\nNew Common-Stock Offerings\nThe following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the\n1959 edition, with comment added:\nCommon-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case\nof companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata\nto the existing stockholders. The subscription price is set below\nthe current market, and the “rights” to subscribe have an initial\nmoney value.* The sale of the new shares is almost always under-\nwritten by one or more investment banking houses, but it is the\ngeneral hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken\nby the exercise of the subscription rights. Thus the sale of addi-\ntional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call\nfor active selling effort on the part of distributing firms.\nThe second type is the placement with the public of common\nstock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of\nthis stock is sold for the account of the controlling interests to\nenable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their\nenthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash. Then the cycle swung the other way\nagain as IPOs dried up in 1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull\nmarket of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-\nness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the\nbubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual\ntotal since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has\nstayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-\ning. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through\nthis manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great IPO boom, back in 1825,\na man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-\nlators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-\ners hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by\n1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.\n*Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already\nown a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same\nproportional interest in the company. This form of financing, still widespread\nin Europe, has become rare in the United States, except among closed-end\nfunds.\nwww.fx1618.com",

(When new money is raised for the business it\ncomes often via the sale of preferred stock, as previously noted.)\nThis activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of\nthe security markets must bring many losses and disappointments\nto the public. The dangers arise both from the character of the\nbusinesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions\nthat make the financing possible.\nIn the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading\ncompanies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the\nnumber of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held\nsteadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have\ntended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-\ncerns. By an unfortunate correlation, during the same period the\nstock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference\nfor the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor\nones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as\nbull markets are built up; the large and quick profits shown by\ncommon stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public’s critical\nfaculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive instinct. During these\nperiods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be\nfound that are enjoying excellent results—although most of these\nwould not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-\nried back, say, ten years or more.\nWhen these factors are put together the following consequences\nemerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first\ncommon-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced\nnot unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of\nthe early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing\ngrows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily\npoorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One\nfairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the\nfact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies\nare offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for\nmany medium-sized companies with a long market history.

In many cases the new issues lose\n75% and more of their offering price. The situation is worsened by\nthe aforementioned fact that, at bottom, the public has a real aver-\nsion to the very kind of small issue that it bought so readily in its\ncareless moments. Many of these issues fall, proportionately, as\nmuch below their true value as they formerly sold above it.\nAn elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil-\nity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-\nstock issues during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found\nthat can pass severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad pol-\nicy to get mixed up in this sort of business. Of course the salesman\nwill point to many such issues which have had good-sized market\nadvances—including some that go up spectacularly the very day\nthey are sold. But all this is part of the speculative atmosphere. It is\neasy money.

If the thing that attracted you in the first place dries up,\nyou’ll find yourself asking, “What else is there?” When the\nanswer is “Nothing,” spouses and bondholders alike end up with\nbroken hearts.\nOn May 9, 2001, WorldCom, Inc. sold the biggest offering\nof bonds in U.S. corporate history—$11.9 billion worth.

For\nmany years in the past this bright idea appeared both simple and\nfeasible, at least from first inspection of a market chart covering its\nperiodic fluctuations.

A growth\nstock may be defined as one that has done this in the past and\nis expected to do so in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that\nthe intelligent investor should concentrate upon the selection of\ngrowth stocks.

Writing in 1972, he con-\ntends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is too\nshort a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his mastery of\nmathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very\nlong samples of large amounts of data.

The first is that com-\nmon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell\nat correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his\njudgment of their prospects and still not fare particularly well,\nmerely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the\nexpected prosperity. The second is that his judgment as to the\nfuture may prove wrong. Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up\nforever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expan-\nsion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement\nmore difficult. At some point the growth curve flattens out, and in\nmany cases it turns downward.\nIt is obvious that if one confines himself to a few chosen\ninstances, based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes\ncan readily be either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How\ncan one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here? We think\nthat reasonably sound conclusions can be drawn from a study of\nthe results achieved by the investment funds specializing in the\ngrowth-stock approach. The authoritative manual entitled Invest-\nment Companies, published annually by Arthur Wiesenberger &\nCompany, members of the New York Stock Exchange, computes\nthe annual performance of some 120 such “growth funds” over a\nperiod of years. Of these, 45 have records covering ten years or\nmore. The average overall gain for these companies—unweighted\nfor size of fund—works out at 108% for the decade 1961–1970,\ncompared with 105% for the S & P composite and 83% for the\nDJIA.3 In the two years 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126\n“growth funds” did worse than either index. Similar results were\nfound in our earlier studies. The implication here is that no out-\nstanding rewards came from diversified investment in growth\ncompanies as compared with that in common stocks generally.*\n*Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in large\ngrowth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth\nfunds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall\nstock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year.

That way, you lower the odds that\nyou will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily high burst\nof profitability. Imagine that a company earned $3 per share over the past\n12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six\nyears.

      "text": "160 The Intelligent Investor\nThe striking thing about growth stocks as a class is their ten-\ndency toward wide swings in market price. This is true of the\nlargest and longest-established companies—such as General Elec-\ntric and International Business Machines—and even more so of\nnewer and smaller successful companies. They illustrate our thesis\nthat the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been\nthe injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com-\npanies which have scored the most brilliant successes, and which\nthemselves would be entitled to a high investment rating. (Their\ncredit standing is of the best, and they pay the lowest interest rates\non their borrowings.) The investment caliber of such a company\nmay not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteris-\ntics of its stockwill depend on what happens to it in the stock mar-\nket. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and the faster\nits advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the\nriskier a proposition it becomes.*\nBut is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes\nfrom common stocks have been garnered by those who made a\nsubstantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose\nfuture they had great confidence, and who held their original\nshares unwaveringly while they increased 100-fold or more in\nvalue? The answer is “Yes.” But the big fortunes from single-\ncompany investments are almost always realized by persons who\nanathema to Graham. How can you value a company based on earnings it\nhasn’t even generated yet? That’s like setting house prices based on a\nrumor that Cinderella will be building her new castle right around the corner.\n*Recent examples hammer Graham’s point home. On September 21,\n2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it expected\nits revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first blush, that\nsounds great; most big companies would be delighted to increase their\nsales by 5% in just three months. But in response, Intel’s stock dropped\n22%, a one-day loss of nearly $91 billion in total value. Why? Wall Street’s\nanalysts had expected Intel’s revenue to rise by up to 10%. Similarly, on\nFebruary 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage firm, announced that it\nexpected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in 2001—but that a new cau-\ntion among customers “may lead to longer selling cycles.” On that whiff of\nhesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their value in a single day.\nwww.fx1618.com",

While small companies may also be\nundervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may later\nincrease their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of a\ndefinitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by\nthe market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thus\nhave a double advantage over the others. First, they have the\nresources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-\nsity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is\nlikely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement\nshown.\nA remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is\nfound in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an\ninvestment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues\nin the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their\ncurrent or previous year’s earnings. These could be called the\n“cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the\nreflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was\nassumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of\nholding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these\ninvestments were then compared with the results shown in either\nthe DJIAas a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-\nular) group.\nThe detailed material we have available covers the results of\nannual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5In the early\nperiod, 1917–1933, this approach proved unprofitable.

Compa-\nnies that are inherently speculative because of widely varying\nearnings tend to sell both at a relatively high price and at a rela-\ntively low multiplier in their good years, and conversely at low\nprices and high multipliers in their bad years. These relationships\nare illustrated in Table 7-3, covering fluctuations of Chrysler Corp.\ncommon.

This time the figures\nproved quite disappointing, showing a sharp loss for the low-\nmultiplier six or ten and a good profit for the high-multiplier selec-\ntions. This one bad instance should not vitiate conclusions based\non 30-odd experiments, but its recent happening gives it a special\nadverse weight. Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with\nthe “low-multiplier” idea, but add other quantitative and qualita-\ntive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.\nPurchase of Bargain Issues\nWe define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts\nestablished by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more\nthan it is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks\nselling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete\nas possible, let us suggest that an issue is not a true “bargain”\nunless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What\nkind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-\nancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does\nthe investor profit from them?\nThere are two tests by which a bargain common stock is\ndetected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely\non estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-\ntor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-\nciently above the market price—and if the investor has confidence\nin the technique employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The\nsecond test is the value of the business to a private owner. This\nvalue also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-\nings—in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in\nthe second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable\nvalue of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current\nassets or working capital.\nAt low points in the general market a large proportion of com-\nmon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A\ntypical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in\n1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning\nin excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.) It is true\nthat current earnings and the immediate prospects may both be\npoor, but a levelheaded appraisal of average future conditions\nwww.fx1618.com",

Thus the wisdom of\nhaving courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the\nvoice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques\nof value analysis.\nThe same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish\na bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of\nmany individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is\nfond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-\nnary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest\nor enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.\nThus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-\ntion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect\nor unpopularity.\nHowever, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,\ncan be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.\nHow can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are\nindeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent\nexamples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous\nfor their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire\nthem at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in\nboom years at a fine profit. Aspectacular example is supplied by\nChrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.\nIf this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating\nearnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy\nmatter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in\n*Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of molehills:\nIn May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nannounced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence drug Viagra had died\nof heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock immediately went flaccid,\nlosing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading. But Pfizer’s shares surged\nahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the\nstock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997, shares of\nWarner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a day when sales of its new diabetes\ndrug were temporarily halted in England; within six months, the stock had\nnearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,\nlost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea\nand vomiting—on ships run by other companies.\nwww.fx1618.com",

One such was Anaconda Wire and\nCable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85\nin that year. The earnings then declined irregularly for six years;\nthe price fell to 231⁄ in 1962, and the following year it was taken\n2\nover by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equiv-\nalent of only 33.\nThe many experiences of this type suggest that the investor\nwould need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price\nto give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indi-\ncation of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past\ndecade or more—i.e., no year of earnings deficit—plus sufficient\nsize and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.\nThe ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent\ncompany selling both well below its past average price and its past\naverage price/earnings multiplier. This would no doubt have\nruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as\nChrysler, since their low-price years are generally accompanied by\nhigh price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader now—and\nno doubt we shall do it again—that there is a world of difference\nbetween “hindsight profits” and “real-money profits.” We doubt\nseriously whether the Chrysler type of roller coaster is a suitable\nmedium for operations by our enterprising investor.\nWehave mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec-\nond cause of price declines to unduly low levels. Acurrent case of\nthis kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull\nmarket of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the\n$5.61 earnings for that year. The per-share profits increased in both\n1969 and 1970, but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was\nless than 4 times the (record) earnings in that year and less than its\nnet-current-asset value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only\n51⁄ times the last reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-\n2\ncurrent-asset value.\nAnother example of this type is provided currently by Standard\nOil of California, a concern of major importance. In early 1972 it\nwas selling at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its\nearnings had been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth\nbut with only one small decline over the entire period. Its book\nvalue was about equal to the market price.

In early\n1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about 10.\nAthird cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may\nbe the market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our\nclassic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946–47\ndeclined from 36 to 131⁄. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were\n2\nclose to $10 per share. The price of the stock was held down in\ngreat part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of\nits earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar\nto railroads.\nThe type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a\ncommon stock that sells for less than the company’s net working\ncapital alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would\nmean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets—\nbuildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.\nVery few companies turn out to have an ultimate value less than\nthe working capital alone, although scattered instances may be\nfound. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many\nenterprises obtainable which have been valued in the market on\nthis bargain basis. Acompilation made in 1957, when the market’s\nlevel was by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common\nstocks.

This has meant that the latter group have usually sold\nat much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have\nthe former. It has meant further that in many instances the price\nhas fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.\nWhen investors rejected the stocks of secondary companies,\neven though these sold at relatively low prices, they were express-\ning a belief or fear that such companies faced a dismal future. In\nfact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that anyprice was too\nhigh for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in\n1929 the companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price\nwas too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-\nless. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive\nof serious investment errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized\nlisted company is a large one when compared with the average pri-\nvately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-\nnies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the\nvicissitudes characteristic of our economy but earning on the\nwhole a fair return on their invested capital.\nThis brief review indicates that the stock market’s attitude\ntoward secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and conse-\nquently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major\nundervaluation. As it happens, the World War II period and the\npostwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to\nthe larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was\nsuspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins\nmore spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the market’s pattern had com-\npletely reversed itself from that before the war.

In a different way this phenomenon was\nrepeated in 1961 and 1968—the emphasis now being placed on\nnew offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-\nary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields\nsuch as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns, and oth-\ners.*\nAs was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most\nheavily on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum\nswing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.\nIf most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what\nreason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-\nuation? For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the\nsame market position as when he bought the issue? The answer\nhere is somewhat complicated. Substantial profits from the pur-\nchase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of\nways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-\nvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will\nultimately affect the price. In a five- to seven-year period these\nadvantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull\nmarket is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it\ntends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.\nFourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-\nuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary\nissues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level\nfor their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many\n*From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed large\nstocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year.

In these cases the consideration paid has almost\nalways been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain\nlevels existing not long before.\nWhen interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of\nbargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at\nlarge discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have\na different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large\ndiscounts if carrying coupon rates of, say, 41⁄% or less. Example:\n2\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄s, due 1986, sold as low as 51\n8\nin 1970; Deere & Co. 41⁄s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may\n2\nwell turn out to have been bargain opportunities before very\nlong—if ruling interest rates should decline substantially. For a\nbargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall\nhave to turn once more to the first-mortgage bonds of railroads\nnow in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-\ntions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values\nin this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-\ndency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently\nthe group as a whole offers an especially rewarding invitation to\ncareful and courageous analysis. In the decade ending in 1948 the\nbillion-dollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer-\nous and spectacular opportunities in this area. Such opportunities\nhave been quite scarce since then; but they seem likely to return in\nthe 1970s.*\n*Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today. How-\never, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds, as well as con-\nvertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer real value in the\nwake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But diversification in this area is\nessential—and impractical without at least $100,000 to dedicate to dis-\ntressed securities alone. Unless you are a millionaire several times over, this\nkind of diversification is not an option.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place\nthemselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is\na compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than\nachievement.\nAs an investor you cannot soundly become “half a business-\nman,” expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business\nprofits on your funds.\nIt follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own-\ners should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the\ntime, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark\nupon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-\nfied with the excellent return now obtainable from a defensive\nportfolio (and with even less), and they should stoutly resist the\nrecurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other\npaths.\nThe enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-\nrity operation for which his training and judgment are adequate\nand which appears sufficiently promising when measured by estab-\nlished business standards.\nIn our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors\nwe have attempted to apply such business standards.

Further-\nmore, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,\nthen these issues would be doomed to sell for less than their fair\nvalue, except to the extent that they were purchased unintelli-\ngently.\nThis may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth\nwe are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area\nfor the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the\nmost part, do fluctuate about a central level which is well below\ntheir fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;\nbut this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-\nsons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of\npaying the prevailing prices for common stocks.\nThus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-\nnize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they\naccept the central market levels that are normal for that class as\ntheir guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.\nThere is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected\nsecondary company may be fully as promising as the average\nindustrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-\nity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-\nsequently it may appear illogical to many readers to term\n“unintelligent” the purchase of such secondary issues at their full\n“enterprise value.” We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-\nrience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect\nsatisfactory results, on the average, from secondary common\nstocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a private\nowner, that is, on a bargain basis.\nwww.fx1618.com",

      "text": "178 The Intelligent Investor\nThe last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi-\nnary outside investor. Anyone who can control a secondary com-\npany, or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully\njustified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest-\ning in a “close corporation” or other private business. The distinc-\ntion between the position, and consequent investment policy, of\ninsiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise\nitself becomes lessimportant. It is a basic characteristic of a primary\nor leading company that a single detached share is ordinarily\nworth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary com-\npanies the averagemarket value of a detached share is substantially\nless than its worth to a controlling owner. Because of this fact, the\nmatter of shareholder-management relations and of those between\ninside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important\nand controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary\ncompanies.\nAt the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak-\ning any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary\ncompanies. The many common stocks in the boundary area may\nproperly exhibit an intermediate price behavior. It would not be\nillogical for an investor to buy such an issue at a small discount\nfrom its indicated or appraisal value, on the theory that it is only a\nsmall distance away from a primary classification and that it may\nacquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.\nThus the distinction between primary and secondary issues\nneed not be made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference\nin quality must produce a large differential in justified purchase\nprice. In saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas-\nsification of common stocks, although we counseled against such a\nmiddle ground in the classification of investors. Our reason for this\napparent inconsistency is as follows: No great harm comes from\nsome uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security, because\nsuch cases are exceptional and not a great deal is at stake in the\nmatter. But the investor’s choice as between the defensive or the\naggressive status is of major consequence to him, and he should\nnot allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci-\nsion.\nwww.fx1618.com",

What Carnegie neg-\nlected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great\nfailuresof life. Look again at the Forbes“Rich List.” Back in 1982, the\naverage net worth of a Forbes 400 member was $230 million. To\nmake it onto the 2002 Forbes 400, the average 1982 member\nneeded to earn only a 4.5% average annual return on his wealth—\nduring a period when even bank accounts yielded far more than that\nand the stock market gained an annual average of 13.2%.\nSo how many of the Forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on\nthe list 20 years later?

When hard\ntimes hit, none of these people—despite all the huge advantages that\ngreat wealth can bring—were properly prepared. They could only\nstand by and wince at the sickening crunch as the constantly chang-\ning economy crushed their only basket and all their eggs.10\n10For the observation that it is amazingly difficult to remain on the Forbes\n400, I am indebted to investment manager Kenneth Fisher (himself a Forbes\ncolumnist).\nwww.fx1618.com",

A less ambitious form of pricing is\nthe simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not\npay too much for your stocks. This may suffice for the defen-\nsive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as\nsuch it represents an essential minimum of attention to market\nlevels.1\nWe are convinced that the intelligent investor can derive satis-\nfactory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure that\nif he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting, he\nwill end up as a speculator and with a speculator’s financial\nresults. This distinction may seem rather tenuous to the layman,\nand it is not commonly accepted on Wall Street. As a matter of\nbusiness practice, or perhaps of thoroughgoing conviction, the\nstock brokers and the investment services seem wedded to the\nprinciple that both investors and speculators in common stocks\nshould devote careful attention to market forecasts.\nThe farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one\nwill find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecast-\ning or timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer-\nable predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the\nasking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts\nupon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is impor-\ntant for him to form someopinion of the future course of the stock\nwww.fx1618.com",

Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to\n3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &\nJenrette, declared that “there’s only 200 or 300 points of downside for the\nNASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It turned out that there were no points\non the upside and more than 2000 on the downside, as NASDAQ kept\ncrashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11.

But a waiting period, as such, is of no conse-\nquence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having\nhis money uninvested until he receives some (presumably) trust-\nworthy signal that the time has come to buy? He enjoys an advan-\ntage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently\nlower priceto offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is\nthat timing is of no real value to the investor unless it coincides\nwith pricing—that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares\nat substantially under his previous selling price.\nIn this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and\nsales has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its\nsignal to buy from a special kind of “breakthrough” of the stock\naverages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-\nthrough on the down side. The calculated—not necessarily\nactual—results of using this method showed an almost unbroken\nseries of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s.

Its spectacular achievement had been in giving a sell\nsignal, at 306, about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping\nits followers out of the long bear market until things had pretty\nwell righted themselves, at 84, in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow\ntheory operated mainly by taking its practitioners out at a pretty\ngood price but then putting them back in again at a higher price.\nFor nearly 30 years thereafter, one would have done appreciably\nbetter by just buying and holding the DJIA.2\nIn our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in\nthe Dow-theory results is not accidental.

Second, in stock-market affairs the popularity of a\ntrading theory has itself an influence on the market’s behavior\nwhich detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.\n(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre-\nate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance or\ndecline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling\nsignal is given. A“stampede” of this kind is, of course, much more\nof a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)\nBuy-Low–Sell-High Approach\nWeare convinced that the average investor cannot deal success-\nfully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can\nhe benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying\nafter each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\nThe fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to\n1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic\ndefinition of a “shrewd investor” was “one who bought in a bear\nmarket when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar-\nket when everyone else was buying.” If we examine our Chart I,\ncovering the fluctuations of the Standard & Poor’s composite index\nbetween 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.\n66), we can readily see why this viewpoint appeared valid until\nfairly recent years.\nBetween 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles,\nrunning from bear-market low to bull-market high and back to\nbear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, four\nran for six or seven years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of\n1921–1932—lasted eleven years. The percentage of advance from\nthe lows to highs ranged from 44% to 500%, with most between\nabout 50% and 100%. The percentage of subsequent declines\nranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40% and 50%.\n(It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a pre-\nceding advance of 100%.)\nwww.fx1618.com",

In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the busi-\nness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low\nof 36.\nThat price was extraordinary. It meant that the preferred and\ncommon were together selling for $126 million, although the com-\npany had just reported that it held $85 million in cash alone and a\nworking capital (or net current assets) of $134 million. A. & P. was\nthe largest retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a\ncontinuous and impressive record of large earnings for many\nyears. Yet in 1938 this outstanding business was considered on\nWall Street to be worth less than its current assets alone—which\nmeans less as a going concern than if it were liquidated. Why?\nFirst, because there were threats of special taxes on chain stores;\nsecond, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and,\nthird, because the general market was depressed. The first of these\nreasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless fear; the\nother two were typical of temporary influences.\nLet us assume that the investor had bought A. & P. common in\n1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80. We\nare far from asserting that the ensuing decline to 36 was of no\nimportance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize\nthe picture with some care, to see whether he had made any mis-\ncalculations. But if the results of his study were reassuring—as\nthey should have been—he was entitled then to disregard the mar-\nket decline as a temporary vagary of finance, unless he had the\nfunds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on\nthe bargain basis offered.\nSequel and Reflections\nThe following year, 1939, A. & P. shares advanced to 1171⁄, or\n2\nthree times the low price of 1938 and well above the average of\n1937. Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no\nmeans uncommon, but in the case of A. & P. it was more striking\nthan most.

Such a price/earnings ratio—which compares\nwith 23 times for the DJIAin that year—must have implied expec-\ntations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no jus-\ntification in the company’s earnings record in the preceding years,\nand it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the\ncourse of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward.\nThe year after the 701⁄ high the price fell by more than half to 34.\n2\nBut this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they\nshowed at the low quotation in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctua-\ntions the price fell to another low of 211⁄ in 1970 and 18 in 1972—\n2\nhaving reported the first quarterly deficitin its history.\nWe see in this history how wide can be the vicissitudes of a\nmajor American enterprise in little more than a single generation,\nand also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and\npessimism the public has valued its shares. In 1938 the business\nwas really being given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was\nclamoring for the shares at a ridiculously high price. After that\ncame a quick loss of half the market value, and some years later a\nsubstantial further decline. In the meantime the company was to\nturn from an outstanding to a mediocre earnings performer; its\nprofit in the boom-year 1968 was to be less than in 1958; it had paid\na series of confusing small stock dividends not warranted by the\ncurrent additions to surplus; and so forth. A. & P. was a larger com-\npany in 1961 and 1972 than in 1938, but not as well-run, not as\nprofitable, and not as attractive.*\nThere are two chief morals to this story.

In reality the owners were better off with the\nlisted securities, despite the low prices of these. For if they had\nwanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold the\nissues—possibly to exchange them for even better bargains. Or\nthey could just as logically have ignored the market’s action as\ntemporary and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell\nyourself that you have suffered no shrinkage in value merely\nbecauseyour securities have no quoted market at all.\nReturning to our A. & P. shareholder in 1938, we assert that as\nlong as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price\ndecline, beyond what his own judgment may have told him was\noccasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If\nno such shrinkage had occurred, he had a right to expect that in\ndue course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or\nbetter—as in fact it did the following year. In this respect his posi-\ntion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private\nbusiness with no quoted market for its shares. For in that case, too,\nhe might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off\npart of the cost of his holdings because of the impact of the 1938\nrecession—depending on what had happened to his company.\nCritics of the value approach to stock investment argue that\nlisted common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in\nthe same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because\nthe presence of an organized security market “injects into equity\nownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity.”\nBut what this liquidity really means is, first, that the investor has\nthe benefit of the stock market’s daily and changing appraisal of\nhis holdings, for whatever that appraisal may be worth, and, second,\nthat the investor is able to increase or decrease his investment at\nthe market’s daily figure—if he chooses. Thus the existence of a\nquoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not\nhave if his security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current\nquotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from\nsome other source.\nLet us close this section with something in the nature of a para-\nble.

Every day he tells you what he thinks your\ninterest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to\nsell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of\nvalue appears plausible and justified by business developments\nand prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr.\nMarket lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the\nvalue he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.\nIf you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you\nlet Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the\nvalue of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree\nwith him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy\nto sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price,\nand equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the\nrest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the\nvalue of your holdings, based on full reports from the company\nabout its operations and financial position.\nThe true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed\ncommon stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or\nleave it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He\nmust take cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise\nhis judgment will have nothing to work on.

(These are the Atchison, Topeka\n& Santa Fe general mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of\nour premier noncallable bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry.\n3s, due 2047—originally a 150-year maturity!—long a typical Baa-\nrated bond.)\nBecause of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond\nto the high prices and vice versa.

It is extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high\nin the next few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly\nbecause of the rise in general interest rates. There have been star-\ntling variations, as well, in the price of even the highest-grade\nbonds in the past forty years.\nNote that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro-\nportion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value\nof 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long\nmaturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields\nchange at close to the same rate.\nSince 1964 record movements in both directionshave taken place\nin the high-grade bond market. Taking “prime municipals” (tax-\nfree) as an example, their yield more than doubled, from 3.2% in\nJanuary 1965 to 7% in June 1970. Their price index declined, corre-\nspondingly, from 110.8 to 67.5. In mid-1970 the yields on high-\ngrade long-term bonds were higher than at any time in the nearly\n200 years of this country’s economic history.* Twenty-five years earlier,\njust before our protracted bull market began, bond yields were at\ntheirlowestpoint in history; long-term municipals returned as little\nas 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared with the 41⁄ to 5% for-\n2\nmerly considered “normal.” Those of us with a long experience on\nWall Street had seen Newton’s law of “action and reaction, equal\nand opposite” work itself out repeatedly in the stock market—the\nmost noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA from 64 in\n1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But\nthis time the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually\nstaid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields.\nMoral: Nothing important on Wall Street can be counted on to\noccur exactly in the same way as it happened before.

Since bond\nyields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that prices had\nrisen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most\nexpensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low.

Hence the investor\nmust choose between long-term and short-term bond investments\non the basis chiefly of his personal preferences. If he wants to be\ncertain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are\nprobably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described\nabove, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first\nyear), the Series E for up to 55⁄ years, the Series H for up to ten\n6\nyears, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.\nIf the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term\ncorporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be\nprepared to see them fluctuate in price.

One possibility would be to\nsell long-term bonds with interest payments that vary with an\nappropriate index of the going rate. The main results of such an\narrangement would be: (1) the investor’s bond would always have\na principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit\nrating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered\non conventional new issues; (2) the corporation would have the\nadvantages of long-term debt—being spared problems and costs of\nfrequent renewals of refinancing—but its interest costs would\nchange from year to year.4\nOver the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by\nan increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability\nof principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)\ninterest rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with\nconsiderable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his princi-\npal value?

In the three months ending in December 1999, Inktomi sold\n$36 million in products and services, more than it had in the entire\nyear ending in December 1998. If Inktomi could sustain its growth\nrate of the previous 12 months for just five more years, its revenues\nwould explode from $36 million a quarter to $5 billion a month. With\nsuch growth in sight, the faster the stock went up, the farther up it\nseemed certain to go.\nBut in his wild love affair with Inktomi’s stock, Mr. Market was over-\nlooking something about its business. The company was losing\nmoney—lots of it. It had lost $6 million in the most recent quarter, $24\nmillion in the 12 months before that, and $24 million in the year before\nthat. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in\nprofits. Yet, on March 17, 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at\na total of $25 billion. (Yes, that’s billion,with a B.)\nAnd then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression.\nOn September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting\n$231.625 per share, Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsing\nfrom a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Had\nInktomi’s business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,\nthe company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what had\nchanged? Only Mr. Market’s mood: In early 2000, investors were\nso wild about the Internet that they priced Inktomi’s shares at 250\ntimes the company’s revenues. Now, however, they would pay only\n0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr.\nHyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool\nout of him.\nBut Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he\nhad been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.\nannounced that it would buy Inktomi for $1.65 per share. That was\nnearly seven times Inktomi’s stock price on September 30. History will\nprobably show that Yahoo! got a bargain. When Mr. Market makes\nstocks so cheap, it’s no wonder that entire companies get bought\nright out from under him.2\n2As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great Depres-\nsion caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the value of\ntheir cash and other liquid assets, making them “worth more dead than\nalive.”\nwww.fx1618.com",

Of course not. You’d insist on\nyour right to take control of your own emotional life, based on your\nexperiences and your beliefs. But, when it comes to their financial\nlives, millions of people let Mr. Market tell them how to feel and what to\ndo—despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can get nuttier\nthan a fruitcake.\nIn 1999, when Mr. Market was squealing with delight, American\nemployees directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their\n401(k) retirement plans. By 2002, after Mr. Market had spent three\nyears stuffing stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribu-\ntion rate had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%.3The cheaper\nstocks got, the less eager people became to buy them—because they\nwere imitating Mr. Market, instead of thinking for themselves.\nThe intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead,\nyou should do business with him—but only to the extent that it serves\nyour interests. Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices; your job\nis to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not\nhave to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.\nBy refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into\nyour servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values,\nhe is creating them elsewhere. In 1999, the Wilshire 5000 index—the\nbroadest measure of U.S. stock performance—gained 23.8%, pow-\nered by technology and telecommunications stocks. But 3,743 of the\n7,234 stocks in the Wilshire index went down in value even as the\naverage was rising. While those high-tech and telecom stocks were\nhotter than the hood of a race car on an August afternoon, thousands\nof “Old Economy” shares were frozen in the mud—getting cheaper and\ncheaper.\nThe stock of CMGI, an “incubator” or holding company for Internet\n3News release, The Spectrem Group, “Plan Sponsors Are Losing the Battle\nto Prevent Declining Participation and Deferrals into Defined Contribution\nPlans,” October 25, 2002.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Meanwhile, Berk-\nshire Hathaway—the holding company through which Graham’s greatest\ndisciple, Warren Buffett, owns such Old Economy stalwarts as Coca-\nCola, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co.—dropped by 24.9%.4\nBut then, as it so often does, the market had a sudden mood\nswing. Figure 8-1 offers a sampling of how the stinkers of 1999 be-\ncame the stars of 2000 through 2002.\nAs for those two holding companies, CMGI went on to lose 96% in\n2000, another 70.9% in 2001, and still 39.8% more in 2002—a cumulative\nloss of 99.3%. Berkshire Hathaway went up 26.6% in 2000 and 6.5% in\n2001, then had a slight 3.8% loss in 2002—a cumulative gain of 30%.\nCAN YOU BEAT THE PROS AT THEIR OWN GAME?\nOne of Graham’s most powerful insights is this: “The investor who\npermits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified mar-\nket declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advan-\ntage into a basic disadvantage.”\nWhat does Graham mean by those words “basic advantage”? He\nmeans that the intelligent individual investor has the full freedom to\nchoose whether or not to follow Mr. Market. You have the luxury of\nbeing able to think for yourself.5\n4A few months later, on March 10, 2000—the very day that NASDAQ hit its all-\ntime high—online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he had “repeat-\nedly” been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway short, a bet that\nBuffett’s stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar thrust of his rhetorical pelvis,\nCramer even declared that Berkshire’s shares were “ripe for the banging.” That\nsame day, market strategist Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked,\n“Norfolk Southern or Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?”\nCisco, a key to tomorrow’s Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over\nNorfolk Southern, part of yesterday’s railroad system. (Over the next year, Nor-\nfolk Southern gained 35%, while Cisco lost 70%.)\n5When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding, Gra-\nham had a concise answer: “The primary cause of failure is that they pay too\nmuch attention to what the stock market is doing currently.” See “Benjamin\nGraham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” [transcript of lecture at Northeast\nMissouri State University Business School, March, 1972], Financial History\nmagazine, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 8.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Here are some of the handicaps mutual-\nfund managers and other professional investors are saddled with:\n• With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate\ntoward the biggest stocks—the only ones they can buy in the\nmultimillion-dollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus\nmany funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants.\n• Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises.\nThe managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they\nalready own, driving prices to even more dangerous heights.\n• If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops,\nthe managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as\nthe funds are forced to buy stocks at inflated prices in a rising\nmarket, they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again.\n• Many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market, so\nthey obsessively measure their returns against benchmarks like\nthe S & P 500 index. If a company gets added to an index, hun-\ndreds of funds compulsively buy it. (If they don’t, and that stock\nthen does well, the managers look foolish; on the other hand, if\nthey buy it and it does poorly, no one will blame them.)\n• Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in\nmedicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric\nallergist and the geriatric otolaryngologist, fund managers must\nbuy only “small growth” stocks, or only “mid-sized value” stocks,\nor nothing but “large blend” stocks.6If a company gets too big, or\ntoo small, or too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has\nto sell it—even if the manager loves the stock.\nSo there’s no reason you can’t do as well as the pros. What you\ncannot do (despite all the pundits who say you can) is to “beat the\npros at their own game.” The pros can’t even win their own game!\nWhy should you want to play it at all? If you follow their rules, you will\nlose—since you will end up as much a slave to Mr. Market as the pro-\nfessionals are.\n6Never mind what these terms mean, or are supposed to mean.

You can’t control whether the stocks or funds you buy\nwill outperform the market today, next week, this month, or this year; in\nthe short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and\nhis whims.

But investing isn’t about beating oth-\ners at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.\nThe challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that\nwill go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent yourself\nfrom being your own worst enemy—from buying high just because Mr.\nMarket says “Buy!” and from selling low just because Mr. Market says\n“Sell!”\nIf you investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is\nonly one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and\nwhenever else you can spare some money.

No one’s gravestone reads “HE\nBEAT THE MARKET.”\nI once interviewed a group of retirees in Boca Raton, one of\nFlorida’s wealthiest retirement communities. I asked these people—\nmostly in their seventies—if they had beaten the market over their\ninvesting lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no; most weren’t sure.\nThen one man said, “Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned\nenough for me to end up in Boca.”\nCould there be a more perfect answer? After all, the whole point of\ninvesting is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough\nmoney to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your invest-\ning success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by\nwhether you’ve put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline\nthat are likely to get you where you want to go. In the end, what mat-\nters isn’t crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making\nsure that you do cross it.8\nYOUR MONEY AND YOUR BRAIN\nWhy,then, do investors find Mr. Market so seductive? It turns out that\nour brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble; humans are\npattern-seeking animals. Psychologists have shown that if you present\npeople with a random sequence—and tell them that it’s unpre-\ndictable—they will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what’s coming\nnext. Likewise, we “know” that the next roll of the dice will be a seven,\nthat a baseball player is due for a base hit, that the next winning num-\nber in the Powerball lottery will definitely be 4-27-9-16-42-10—and\nthat this hot little stock is the next Microsoft.\nGroundbreaking new research in neuroscience shows that our\nbrains are designed to perceive trends even where they might not\nexist. After an event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of\nthe human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens\nautomatically anticipate that it will happen again. If it does repeat, a\nnatural chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with\na soft euphoria. Thus, if a stock goes up a few times in a row, you\nreflexively expect it to keep going—and your brain chemistry changes\n8See Jason Zweig, “Did You Beat the Market?” Money,January, 2000, pp.\n55–58. www.fx1618.com",

Just as you can’t keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm\ngoes off, just as you can’t avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto\nyour hiking path, you can’t help feeling fearful when stock prices are\nplunging.9\nIn fact, the brilliant psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tver-\nsky have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as\nintense as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. Making $1,000 on a\nstock feels great—but a $1,000 loss wields an emotional wallop more\nthan twice as powerful. Losing money is so painful that many people,\nterrified at the prospect of any further loss, sell out near the bottom or\nrefuse to buy more.\nThat helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market\ndecline and forget to put the loss in proportion. So, if a TV reporter\nhollers, “The market is plunging—the Dow is down 100 points!” most\npeople instinctively shudder. But, at the Dow’s recent level of 8,000,\nthat’s a drop of just 1.2%.

MARKET GIVES YOU LEMONS,\nMAKE LEMONADE\nAlthough Graham teaches that you should buy when Mr. Market is\nyelling “sell,” there’s one exception the intelligent investor needs to\nunderstand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a\ntax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your\nrealized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your\nshares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income.12 Let’s say you\nbought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for $60 a\nshare—a total investment of $12,000. By year-end 2002, the stock\nwas down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lot—a loss of $3,200.\nYou could have done what most people do—either whine about\nyour loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.\nOr you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have\nsold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after wait-\ning 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of\nCoke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your tax-\nable income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining\n$200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would\nstill own a company whose future you believe in—but now you would\nown it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.13\nWith Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell\nand lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logical\nby comparison, who are we to complain?\n12Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of Coca-Cola\nstock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax code as it stood\nin early 2003.\n13This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital gains in\n2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends. Tax swaps are not to be\nundertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before doing a tax\nswap, read IRS Publication 550 (www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf).

Those that are redeemable on\ndemand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as\n“mutual funds” (or “open-end funds”). Most of these are actively\nselling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with\nnonredeemable shares are called “closed-end” companies or funds;\nthe number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of the\nfunds of any importance are registered with the Securities &\nExchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and\ncontrols.*\nThe industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were\n383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-\nlions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutual\nfunds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†\nThere are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the\nbroad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they\nhave a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,\nor “stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.\n(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge\n*It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end\nfund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has\n“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.\n†The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At year-end\n2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-end\nfunds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFs\nwith $109.7 billion.

Another distinction is by their method of sale.\n“Load funds” add a selling charge (generally about 9% of asset\nvalue on minimum purchases) to the value before charge.1Others,\nknown as “no-load” funds, make no such charge; the manage-\nments are content with the usual investment-counsel fees for han-\ndling the capital. Since they cannot pay salesmen’s commissions,\nthe size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.† The buy-\ning and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by the\ncompanies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary\ncorporate stock.\nMost of the companies operate under special provisions of the\nincome-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double\ntaxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out vir-\ntually all their ordinary income—i.e., dividends and interest\nreceived, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized\nlong-term profits on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-\ngains dividends”—which are treated by the shareholder as if they\nwere his own security profits.

Anew wrinkle, introduced in 1967, divides\nthe capitalization into a preferred issue, which will receive all the\nordinary income, and a capital issue, or common stock, which will\nreceive all the profits on security sales. (These are called “dual-\npurpose funds.”)*\nMany of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital\ngains concentrate on the purchase of the so-called “growth stocks,”\nand they often have the word “growth” in their name. Some spe-\ncialize in a designated area such as chemicals, aviation, overseas\ninvestments; this is usually indicated in their titles.\nThe investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in\nfund shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of\nchoices before him—not too different from those offered in direct\ninvestment. In this chapter we shall deal with some major ques-\ntions, viz:\n1. Is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of\nbetter than average results by choosing the right funds? (Subques-\ntion: What about the “performance funds”?)†\n2. If not, how can he avoid choosing funds that will give him\nworse than average results?\n3. Can he make intelligent choices between different types of\nfunds—e.g., balanced versus all-stock, open-end versus closed-\nend, load versus no-load?\nGraham omits “to avoid clutter,” a fund can ask the SEC for special permis-\nsion to distribute one of its holdings directly to the fund’s shareholders—as\nhis Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling out shares in GEICO to\nGraham-Newman’s own investors. This sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare.\n*Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially disap-\npeared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a more\nflexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like John\nNeff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a renaissance of this\nattractive investment vehicle.\n†“Performance funds” were all the rage in the late 1960s.

      "text": "Investing in Investment Funds 229\nInvestment-Fund Performance as a Whole\nBefore trying to answer these questions we should say some-\nthing about the performance of the fund industry as a whole. Has\nit done a good job for its shareholders? In the most general way,\nhow have fund investors fared as against those who made their\ninvestments directly? We are quite certain that the funds in the\naggregate have served a useful purpose. They have promoted\ngood habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-\nless individuals against costly mistakes in the stock market; they\nhave brought their participants income and profits commensurate\nwith the overall returns from common stocks. On a comparative\nbasis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who\nput his money exclusively in investment-fund shares in the past\nten years has fared better than the average person who made his\ncommon-stock purchases directly.\nThe last point is probably true even though the actual perfor-\nmance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com-\nmon stocks as a whole, and even though the cost of investing in\nmutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases.\nThe real choice of the average individual has not been between\nconstructing and acquiring a well-balanced common-stock portfo-\nlio or doing the same thing, a bit more expensively, by buying into\nthe funds. More likely his choice has been between succumbing to\nthe wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one\nhand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and much more\ndangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings. We\ncannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a\nbrokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-\nstock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ-\nences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these\ntemptations should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.\nBut how have the investment funds performed as against the\ngeneral market? This is a somewhat controversial subject, but we\nshall try to deal with it in simple but adequate fashion. Table 9-1\ngives some calculated results for 1961–1970 of our ten largest stock\nfunds at the end of 1970, but choosing only the largest one from\neach management group.

These companies had combined\nassets of over $15 billion at the end of 1969, or about one-third of all\nthe common-stock funds. Thus they should be fairly representative\nof the industry as a whole. (In theory, there should be a bias in this\nlist on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-\nter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion\nthan the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)\nSome interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we\nfind that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were\nnot appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock composite average (or the S & P 425-industrial stock aver-\nage). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA. (This\nraises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA\ndid worse than the much more numerous and apparently rather\nmiscellaneous list used by Standard & Poor’s.)* Asecond point is\nthat the funds’ aggregate performance as against the S & P index\nhas improved somewhat in the last five years, compared with the\npreceding five. The funds’ gain ran a little lower than S & P’s in\n1961–1965 and a little higher than S & P’s in 1966–1970. The third\npoint is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-\nvidual funds.\nWe do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for\ndoing no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and\ntheir professional competitors administer so large a portion of all\nmarketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a\nwhole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their\nfunds. (Note that the trust assets of insured commercial banks\nincluded $181 billion of common stocks at the end of 1969; if we\nadd to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment\nadvisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must\nconclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty\nwell determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the\n*For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500\ncan diverge by fairly wide margins.

Obviously all\ninvestors could not do this, since in that case we would soon be\nback where we started, with no one doing better than anyone else.\nLet us consider the question first in a simplified fashion. Why\nshouldn’t the investor find out what fund has made the best show-\ning of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume\nfrom this that its management is the most capable and will there-\nfore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that\nfund? This idea appears the more practicable because, in the case\nof the mutual funds, he could obtain this “most capable manage-\nment” without paying any special premium for it as against the\nother funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment corporations the\nbest-managed companies sell at correspondingly high prices in\nrelation to their current earnings and assets.)\nThe evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years.\nBut our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the\nresults shown by the top five performers of 1961–1965 carried over\non the wholethrough 1966–1970, even though two of this set did not\ndo as well as two of the other five. Our studies indicate that the\ninvestor in mutual-fund shares may properly consider compara-\ntive performance over a period of years in the past, say at least five,\nprovidedthe data do not represent a large net upward movement of\nthe market as a whole. In the latter case spectacularly favorable\nresults may be achieved in unorthodox ways—as will be demon-\nstrated in our following section on “performance” funds. Such\nresults in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are\ntaking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the\ntime being.\n“Performance” Funds\nOne of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance\nof the cult of “performance” in the management of investment\nfunds (and even of many trust funds).

Some of those in\ncharge set out to get much better than average (or DJIA) results.\nThey succeeded in doing this for a while, garnering considerable\npublicity and additional funds to manage. The aim was legitimate\nenough; unfortunately, it appears that, in the context of investing\nreally sizable funds, the aim cannot be accomplished without\nincurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively short time the risks\ncame home to roost.\nSeveral of the circumstances surrounding the “performance”\nphenomenon caused ominous headshaking by those of us whose\nexperience went far back—even to the 1920s—and whose views,\nfor that very reason, were considered old-fashioned and irrelevant\nto this (second) “New Era.” In the first place, and on this very\npoint, nearly all these brilliant performers were young men—in\ntheir thirties and forties—whose direct financial experience was\nlimited to the all but continuous bull market of 1948–1968. Sec-\nondly, they often acted as if the definition of a “sound investment”\nwas a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the\nnext few months. This led to large commitments in newer ventures\nat prices completely disproportionate to their assets or recorded\nearnings. They could be “justified” only by a combination of naïve\nhope in the future accomplishments of these enterprises with an\napparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of\nthe uninformed and greedy public.\nThis section will not mention people’s names. But we have\nevery reason to give concrete examples of companies. The “perfor-\nmance fund” most in the public’s eye was undoubtedly Manhattan\nFund, Inc., organized at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27\nmillion shares at $9.25 to $10 per share. The company started out\nwith $247 million of capital. Its emphasis was, of course, on capital\ngains. Most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul-\ntipliers of current earnings, paying no dividends (or very small\nones), with a large speculative following and spectacular price\nmovements. The fund showed an overall gain of 38.6% in 1967,\nagainst 11% for the S & Pcomposite index. But thereafter its perfor-\nmance left much to be desired, as is shown in Table 9-2.\nwww.fx1618.com",

It is another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of\nthese doomed companies were bought not only by investment\nfunds but by university endowment funds, the trust departments\nof large banking institutions, and the like.* A third extraordinary\nfact was that the founder-manager of Manhattan Fund sold his\nstock in a separately organized management company to another\nlarge concern for over $20 million in its stock; at that time the man-\nagement company sold had less than $1 million in assets.

But it is probably too much to expect that\nthe urge to speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of\nthat urge can ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the\nintelligent investor to know about these “Extraordinary Popular\nDelusions,”4and to keep as far away from them as possible.\nThe picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we\nstart after their spectacular record in 1967. With the 1967 figures\nincluded, their overall showing is not at all disastrous. On that\nbasis one of “The Money Managers” operators did quite a bit better\nthan the S & Pcomposite index, three did distinctly worse, and six\ndid about the same. Let us take as a check another group of perfor-\nmance funds—the ten that made the best showing in 1967, with\ngains ranging from 84% up to 301% in that single year. Of these,\nfour gave a better overall four-year performance than the S & P\nindex, if the 1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in\n1968–1970. None of these funds was large, and the average size\nwas about $60 million. Thus, there is a strong indication that\nsmaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand-\ning results.\nThe foregoing account contains the implicit conclusion that\nthere may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor-\nmance by investment-fund managers. All financial experience up\nto now indicates that large funds, soundly managed, can produce\nat best only slightly better than average results over the years. If\nthey are unsoundly managed they can produce spectacular, but\nlargely illusory, profits for a while, followed inevitably by calami-\ntous losses. There have been instances of funds that have consis-\ntently outperformed the market averages for, say, ten years or\nmore. But these have been scarce exceptions, having most of their\noperations in specialized fields, with self-imposed limits on the\ncapital employed—and not actively sold to the public.*\n*Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be open-end\nfundsw thwatw ar.ef xcl1os6e1d 8to. cneowm investors—meaning that the managers have",

By this means most of them have grown in size over\nthe years. The closed-end companies, nearly all of which were\norganized a long time ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus\nhave diminished in relative dollar importance. Open-end compa-\nnies are being sold by many thousands of energetic and persuasive\nsalesmen, the closed-end shares have no one especially interested\nin distributing them. Consequently it has been possible to sell most\n“mutual funds” to the public at a fixed premium of about 9%\nabove net asset value (to cover salesmen’s commissions, etc.),\nwhile the majority of close-end shares have been consistently\nobtainable at lessthan their asset value. This price discount has var-\nied among individual companies, and the average discount for the\ngroup as a whole has also varied from one date to another. Figures\non this point for 1961–1970 are given in Table 9-3.\nIt does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower rela-\ntive price for closed-end as against open-end shares has very little\nto do with the difference in the overall investment results between\nthe two groups. That this is true is indicated by the comparison of\nthe annual results for 1961–1970 of the two groups included in\nTable 9-3.\nThus we arrive at one of the few clearly evident rules for\ninvestors’ choices. If you want to put money in investment funds,\nbuy a group of closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15%\nfrom asset value, instead of paying a premium of about 9% above\nasset value for shares of an open-end company. Assuming that the\nfuture dividends and changes in asset values continue to be about\nthe same for the two groups, you will thus obtain about one-fifth\nmore for your money from the closed-end shares.\nThe mutual-fund salesman will be quick to counter with the\nstopped taking in any more cash.

Psychologists\nhave shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the\nlong run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.\nWhat’s more, we know from our own experience that some plumbers\nare far better than others, that some baseball players are much more\nlikely to hit home runs, that our favorite restaurant serves consistently\nsuperior food, and that smart kids get consistently good grades. Skill\nand brains and hard work are recognized, rewarded—and consistently\nrepeated—all around us. So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition\ntells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming.\nUnfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than\nskill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at\njust the right time, he will look brilliant—but all too often, what was hot\nsuddenly goes cold and the manager’s IQ seems to shrivel by 50\npoints.

Financial scholars have been\nstudying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they\nare virtually unanimous on several points:\n• the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome\nits costs of researching and trading them;\n• the higher a fund’s expenses, the lower its returns;\n• the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to\nearn;\n1Sector funds specializing in almost every imaginable industry are avail-\nable—and date back to the 1920s.

(If your company doesn’t offer a low-cost index fund in your\n401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its\nrock-bottom overhead—operating expenses of 0.2% annually, and\nyearly trading costs of just 0.1%—give the index fund an insurmount-\nable advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over\nthe next 20 years, a low-cost index fund like Vanguard Total Stock\nMarket will return just under 6.7%. (That would turn a $10,000 invest-\nment into more than $36,000.) But the average stock fund, with\nits 1.5% in operating expenses and roughly 2% in trading costs, will\nbe lucky to gain 3.5% annually. (That would turn $10,000 into just\nunder $20,000—or nearly 50% less than the result from the index\nfund.)\nIndex funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. You’ll\nnever be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the\ntop-performing fund in the country. You’ll never be able to boast that\nyou beat the market, because the job of an index fund is to match the\nmarket’s return, not to exceed it. Your index-fund manager is not likely\nto “roll the dice” and gamble that the next great industry will be tele-\nportation, or scratch-’n’-sniff websites, or telepathic weight-loss clin-\nics; the fund will always own every stock, not just one manager’s best\nguess at the next new thing. But, as the years pass, the cost advan-\ntage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly. Hold an index fund for\n20 years or more, adding new money every month, and you are all but\ncertain to outperform the vast majority of professional and individual\ninvestors alike. Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best\nchoice for individual investors, as does Warren Buffett.6\n6See Benjamin Graham, Benjamin Graham: Memoirs of the Dean of Wall\nStreet,Seymour Chatman, ed. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996), p. 273, and\nJanet Lowe, The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the\nWall Street Legend(John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), p. 273. As War-\nren Buffett wrote in his 1996 annual report: “Most investors, both institu-\ntional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is\nthrough an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path\nare sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the\ngreat majority of investment professionals.” (See www.berkshirehathaway.\ncom/w19w96war/.1f9x9166.h1tm8l.).com",

      "text": "250 Commentary on Chapter 9\nTILTING THE TABLES\nWhen you add up all their handicaps, the wonder is not that so few\nfunds beat the index, but that any do. And yet, some do. What quali-\nties do they have in common?\nTheir managers are the biggest shareholders. The conflict of\ninterest between what’s best for the fund’s managers and what’s best\nfor its investors is mitigated when the managers are among the\nbiggest owners of the fund’s shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Part-\nners, even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own\nfunds. At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers\nown so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money\nas if it were their own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let\nthe funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A\nfund’s proxy statement and Statement of Additional Information, both\navailable from the Securities and Exchange Commission through the\nEDGAR database at www.sec.gov, disclose whether the managers\nown at least 1% of the fund’s shares.\nThey are cheap.One of the most common myths in the fund busi-\nness is that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best\njustification for higher fees. There are two problems with this argu-\nment. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that funds\nwith higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns\nare temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If\nyou buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful\nof cold ashes—but your costs of owning the fund are almost certain\nnotto decline when its returns do.\nThey dare to be different.When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he\nbought whatever seemed cheap to him—regardless of what other fund\nmanagers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;\nright after that, he made Chrysler his top holding, even though most\nexperts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put\nalmost 20% of Fidelity Magellan in foreign stocks like Honda, Norsk\nHydro, and Volvo. So, before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the hold-\nings listed in its latest report against the roster of the S & P 500 index; if\nthey look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum, shop for another fund.7\n7A complete listing of the S & P 500’s constituent companies is available at\nwww.stawndwardwan.dfpxo1or6s.1co8m..com",

That stops the\nfeeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and pro-\ntects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis. It’s also a signal\nthat the fund managers are not putting their own wallets ahead of\nyours. But the closing should occur before—not after—the fund\nexplodes in size. Some companies with an exemplary record of shut-\nting their own gates are Longleaf, Numeric, Oakmark, T.

They don’t appear constantly on\nfinancial television or run ads boasting of their No. 1 returns. The steady lit-\ntle Mairs & Power Growth Fund didn’t even have a website until 2001 and\nstill sells its shares in only 24 states. The Torray Fund has never run a retail\nadvertisement since its launch in 1990.\nWhat else should you watch for? Most fund buyers look at past\nperformance first, then at the manager’s reputation, then at the riski-\nness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund’s expenses.8\nThe intelligent investor looks at those same things—but in the oppo-\nsite order.\nSince a fund’s expenses are far more predictable than its future risk\nor return, you should make them your first filter. There’s no good rea-\nson ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses,\nby fund category:\n• Taxable and municipal bonds: 0.75%\n• U.S. equities (large and mid-sized stocks): 1.0%\n• High-yield (junk) bonds: 1.0%\n8See Noel Capon, Gavan Fitzsimons, and Russ Alan Prince, “An Individual\nLevel Analysis of the Mutual Fund Investment Decision,” Journal of Finan-\ncial Services Research, vol. 10, 1996, pp. 59–82; Investment Company\nInstitute, “Understanding Shareholders’ Use of Information and Advisers,”\nSpring, 1997, at www.ici.org/pdf/rpt_undstnd_share.pdf, p. 21; Gordon\nAlexander, Jonathan Jones, and Peter Nigro, “Mutual Fund Shareholders:\nCharacteristics, Investor Knowledge, and Sources of Information,” OCC\nworking paper, December, 1997, at www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/workpaper/\nwp97w-1w3.pwdf..fx1618.com",

In its prospectus (or buyer’s guide), every fund\nmust show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quar-\nter. If you can’t stand losing at least that much money in three months,\ngo elsewhere. It’s also worth checking a fund’s Morningstar rating. A\nleading investment research firm, Morningstar awards “star ratings” to\nfunds, based on how much risk they took to earn their returns (one\nstar is the worst, five is the best). But, just like past performance itself,\nthese ratings look back in time; they tell you which funds were the\nbest, not which are going to be. Five-star funds, in fact, have a discon-\ncerting habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first find\na low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be\ndifferent, don’t hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to\nshut down before they get too big for their britches.

Research by closed-end fund\nexpert Donald Cassidy of Lipper Inc. reinforces Graham’s earlier\nobservations: Diversified closed-end stock funds trading at a discount\nnot only tend to outperform those trading at a premium but are likely\nto have a better return than the average open-end mutual fund.\nSadly, however, diversified closed-end stock funds are not always\navailable at a discount in what has become a dusty, dwindling\nmarket.11\nBut there are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially\nstrong choices available in the municipal-bond area.

These low-cost “ETFs” sometimes offer the only\nmeans by which an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market like,\nsay, companies based in Belgium or stocks in the semiconductor\nindustry. Other index ETFs offer much broader market exposure. How-\never, they are generally not suitable for investors who wish to add\nmoney regularly, since most brokers will charge a separate commis-\nsion on every new investment you make.13\n11Unlike a mutual fund, a closed-end fund does not issue new shares\ndirectly to anyone who wants to buy them. Instead, an investor must buy\nshares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is willing\nto part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates above and below\ntheir net asset value, depending on supply and demand.\n12For more information, see www.morningstar.com and www.etfconnect.\ncom.\n13Unlike index mutual funds, index ETFs are subject to standard stock com-\nmissions when you buy and sell them—and these commissions are often\nassessed on any additional purchases or reinvested dividends.

But this advice makes no sense. From its birth in 1970\nthrough 1999, the Sequoia Fund underperformed the S & P 500\nindex in 12 out of its 29 years—or more than 41% of the time. Yet\nSequoia gained more than 12,500% over that period, versus 4,900%\nfor the index.14\nThe performance of most funds falters simply because the type of\nstocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. If you hired a manager\nto invest in a particular way, why fire him for doing what he promised?\nBy selling when a style of investing is out of fashion, you not only lock\nin a loss but lock yourself out of the all-but-inevitable recovery. One\nstudy showed that mutual-fund investors underperformed their own\nfunds by 4.7 percentage points annually from 1998 through 2001—\nsimply by buying high and selling low.15\nSo when should you sell?

This\n“I’m-in-control-here” feeling is part of the human condition; it’s\nwhat psychologists call overconfidence. Here are just a few\nexamples of how it works:\n• In 1999, Money Magazine asked more than 500 people\nwhether their portfolios had beaten the market. One in four\nsaid yes. When asked to specify their returns, however, 80%\nof those investors reported gains lower than the market’s.\n(Four percent had no idea how much their portfolios rose—\nbut were sure they had beaten the market anyway!)\n• A Swedish study asked drivers who had been in severe car\ncrashes to rate their own skills behind the wheel. These peo-\nple—including some the police had found responsible for the\naccidents and others who had been so badly injured that\nthey answered the survey from their hospital beds—insisted\nthey were better-than-average drivers.\n• In a poll taken in late 2000, Timeand CNN asked more than\n1,000 likely voters whether they thought they were in the top\n1% of the population by income. Nineteen percent placed\nthemselves among the richest 1% of Americans.\n• In late 1997, a survey of 750 investors found that 74%\nbelieved their mutual-fund holdings would “consistently beat\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500 each year”—even though most\nfunds fail to beat the S & P 500 in the long run and many fail\nto beat it in anyyear.1\nWhile this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psy-\nche, that doesn’t make it good investment policy.

For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been\nmoving in the direction of closer and stricter controls over the\noperations and financial condition of its members—including min-\nimum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides\nthis, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their\nmembers by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally,\nthe stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable\nconditions—namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum\ncommission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-\nited number of member firms.\nThe first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969)\nwere attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was\nclaimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and\nproduced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should\nbe pointed out this was probably the first time in history that\nimportant enterprises have gone broke because they had more\nbusiness than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures\nincreased, they were blamed chiefly on “the falling off in volume.”\nA strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the\n*The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan\n& Co. and Goodbody & Co.

It seems that a good part of the cap-\nital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common\nstocks owned by the individual partners. Some of these seem to\nhave been highly speculative and carried at inflated values. When\nthe market declined in 1969 the quotations of such securities fell\ndrastically and a substantial part of the capital of the firms van-\nished with them.2 In effect the partners were speculating with the\ncapital that was supposed to protect the customers against the\nordinary financial hazards of the brokerage business, in order to\nmake a double profit thereon.

Anumber of the brokerage houses carry on a certain\namount of underwriting activity. Generally this is confined to par-\nticipating in underwriting groups formed by leading investment\nbankers.

In\nthis business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd\nand experienced buyers. Hence any recommendations made by the\ninvestment bankers to these customers have had to pass careful\nand skeptical scrutiny. Thus these transactions are almost always\neffected on a businesslike footing.\nBut a different situation obtains in a relationship between the\nindividualsecurity buyer and the investment banking firms, includ-\ning the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is\nfrequently inexperienced and seldom shrewd. He is easily influ-\nenced by what the salesman tells him, especially in the case of\ncommon-stock issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying\nis chiefly to make a quick profit. The effect of all this is that the\npublic investor’s protection lies less in his own critical faculty than\nin the scruples and ethics of the offering houses.3\nIt is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting\nfirms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles\nof adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust\nhimself to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this\npoint: “The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves\nrecurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the\nsale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-\ntion.” Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed.

A vote of\nconfidence from someone you admire is a good start.2\nOnce you have the name of the adviser and his firm, as well as his\nspecialty—is he a stockbroker? financial planner? accountant? insur-\nance agent?—you can begin your due diligence. Enter the name of the\nadviser and his or her firm into an Internet search engine like Google\nto see if anything comes up (watch for terms like “fine,” “complaint,”\n“lawsuit,” “disciplinary action,” or “suspension”). If the adviser is a\nstockbroker or insurance agent, contact the office of your state’s\nsecurities commissioner (a convenient directory of online links is at\nwww.nasaa.org) to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer\ncomplaints have been filed against the adviser.3 If you’re considering\nan accountant who also functions as a financial adviser, your state’s\naccounting regulators (whom you can find through the National Asso-\nciation of State Boards of Accountancy at www.nasba.org) will tell\nyou whether his or her record is clean.\nFinancial planners (or their firms) must register with either the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or securities regulators in the\nstate where their practice is based. As part of that registration, the\nadviser must file a two-part document called Form ADV. You should be\nable to view and download it at www.advisorinfo.sec.gov, www.iard.\ncom, or the website of your state securities regulator. Pay special\nattention to the Disclosure Reporting Pages, where the adviser must\ndisclose any disciplinary actions by regulators.

And a discipli-\nnary action by state or Federal regulators usually tells you to find another\nadviser. Another source for checking a broker’s record is http://pdpi.nasdr.\ncom/PDPwI.ww.fx1618.com",

What is the mission statement of your\nfirm? Besides your alarm clock, what makes you get up in the morning?\nWhat is your investing philosophy? Do you use stocks or mutual\nfunds? Do you use technical analysis? Do you use market timing? (A\n“yes” to either of the last two questions is a “no” signal to you.)\nDo you focus solely on asset management, or do you also advise\non taxes, estate and retirement planning, budgeting and debt manage-\nment, and insurance? How do your education, experience, and cre-\ndentials qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice?5\nWhat needs do your clients typically have in common? How can\nyou help me achieve my goals? How will you track and report my\nprogress? Do you provide a checklist that I can use to monitor the\nimplementation of any financial plan we develop?\n4Robert Veres, editor and publisher of the Inside Information newsletter,\ngenerously shared these responses for this book. Other checklists of ques-\ntions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and www.napfa.org.\n5Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has taken\nand passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other “alphabet soup”\nof credentials brandished by financial planners, including the “CFM” or the\n“CMFC,” signify very little.) More important, by contacting the organization\nthat awards the credential, you can verify his record and check that he has\nnot been disciplined for violations of rules or ethics.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Financial analysts have textbooks, a code\nof ethics, and a quarterly journal.* They also have their share of\nunresolved problems.

It would be useful to think of security analysis as limiting\nitself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and\nbonds, whereas financial analysis would comprise that work, plus\nthe determination of investment policy (portfolio selection), plus a\nsubstantial amount of general economic analysis.1 In this chapter\nwe shall use whatever designation is most applicable, with chief\nemphasis on the work of the security analyst proper.\nThe security analyst deals with the past, the present, and the\nfuture of any given security issue.

Finally, he expresses\nan opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment-\ngrade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it\nis a common stock.\nIn doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a\nnumber of techniques, ranging from the elementary to the most\nabstruse. He may modify substantially the figures in the\ncompany’s annual statements, even though they bear the sacred\nimprimaturof the certified public accountant. He is on the lookout\nparticularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal\nmore or less than they say.\nThe security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by\nwhich we can conclude whether a given bond or preferred stock\nmay be termed sound enough to justify purchase for investment.\nThese standards relate primarily to past average earnings, but they\nare concerned also with capital structure, working capital, asset\nvalues, and other matters.\nIn dealing with common stocks the security analyst until\nrecently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined\nas were his standards of safety for bonds and preferred stocks.\nMost of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-\nformances, a more or less general forecast of the future—with par-\nticular emphasis on the next 12 months—and a rather arbitrary\nconclusion.

In the past few years, how-\never, much attention has been given by practicing analysts to the\nproblem of valuing growth stocks. Many of these have sold at such\nhigh prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec-\nommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur-\nchase by fairly definite projections of expected earnings running\nfairly far into the future. Certain mathematical techniques of a\nrather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the\nvaluations arrived at.\nWeshall deal with these techniques, in foreshortened form, a lit-\ntle later.

Thus it may be\nsaid that security analysts today find themselves compelled to\nbecome most mathematical and “scientific” in the very situations\nwhich lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment.*\nLet us proceed, nonetheless, with our discussion of the more\nimportant elements and techniques of security analysis. The pres-\nent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non-\nprofessional investor.

If, for instance, you estimate that a company earning $1 per\nshare can raise that profit by 15% a year for the next 15 years, its earnings\nwould end up at $8.14. If the market values the company at 35 times earn-\nings, the stock would finish the period at roughly $285. But if earnings grow\nat 14% instead of 15%, the company would earn $7.14 at the end of the\nperiod—and, in the shock of that shortfall, investors would no longer be will-\ning to pay 35 times earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would\nend up around $140 per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced\nmathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process\nof foreseeing the future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who\nclaims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems.\nAs Graham put it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have\nnever seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\nrelated investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most\nelementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you\ncould take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute\ntheory for experience, and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive\nguise of investment.” (See p. 570.)\nwww.fx1618.com",

Let us pass on to two basic questions underlying the selection\nof investments. What are the primary tests of safety of a corporate\nbond or preferred stock? What are the chief factors entering into\nthe valuation of a common stock?\nBond Analysis\nThe most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of\nsecurity analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of bond\nissues and investment-grade preferred stocks. The chief criterion\nused for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest\ncharges have been covered by available earnings for some years in\nthe past. In the case of preferred stocks, it is the number of times\nthat bond interest and preferred dividends combined have been\ncovered.\nThe exact standards applied will vary with different authorities.\nSince the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determine\nprecisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-\nbook, Security Analysis, we recommend certain “coverage” stan-\ndards, which appear in Table 11-1.*\nOur basic test is applied only to the average results for a period\nof years. Other authorities require also that a minimumcoverage be\nshown for every year considered. We approve a “poorest-year” test\n*In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to assemble\nhis or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds invest in corporate\nbonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified bundle of securities. Since it is\nnot feasible to build a diversified bond portfolio on your own unless you\nhave at least $100,000, the typical intelligent investor will be best off simply\nbuying a low-cost bond fund and leaving the painstaking labor of credit\nresearch to its managers.

Investment history shows that bonds and pre-\nferred stocks that have met stringent tests of safety, based on the\npast, have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi-\ntudes of the future successfully. This has been strikingly demon-\nstrated in the major field of railroad bonds—a field that has been\nmarked by a calamitous frequency of bankruptcies and serious\nlosses. In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long\nbeen overbonded, had shown an inadequate coverage of fixed\ncharges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been\nruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,\npractically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial\nembarrassment. Our premise was strikingly vindicated by the\nfinancial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s\nand in 1950. All of these, with one exception, started their careers\nwith fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of\nfixed-interest requirements was ample, or at least respectable. The\nexception was the New Haven Railroad, which in its reorganization\nyear, 1947, earned its new charges only about 1.1 times. In conse-\nquence, while all the other roads were able to come through rather\ndifficult times with solvency unimpaired, the New Haven relapsed\ninto trusteeship (for the third time) in 1961.\nIn Chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank-\nruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad, which shook the financial\ncommunity in 1970. An elementary fact in this case was that the\ncoverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as\nearly as 1965; hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided\nor disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan-\ncial collapse.\nOur observations on the adequacy of the past record to judge\nfuture safety apply, and to an even greater degree, to the public\nutilities, which constitute a major area for bond investment.\nReceivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or\nsystem is almost impossible.

The financial troubles of elec-\ntric and gas utilities in the 1930s were traceable almost 100% to\nfinancial excesses and mismanagement, which left their imprint\nclearly on the companies’ capitalization structures. Simple but\nstringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the investor\naway from the issues that were later to default.\nAmong industrial bond issues the long-term record has been\ndifferent. Although the industrial group as a whole has shown a\nbetter growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util-\nities, it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ-\nual companies and lines of business. Thus in the past, at least, there\nhave been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus-\ntrial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of\nmajor size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a\nserious depression.\nFew defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950, but\nthis fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression\nduring this long period. Since 1966 there have been adverse devel-\nopments in the financial position of many industrial companies.\nConsiderable difficulties have developed as the result of unwise\nexpansion. On the one hand this has involved large additions to\nboth bank loans and long-term debt; on the other it has frequently\nproduced operating losses instead of the expected profits. At the\nbeginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the\ninterest payments of all nonfinancial firms had grown from $9.8\nbillion in 1963 to $26.1 billion in 1970, and that interest payments\nhad taken 29% of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in\n1971, against only 16% in 1963.3 Obviously, the burden on many\nindividual firms had increased much more than this.

Future sales in dollars are then\nprojected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in\nvolume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in\nturn, are grounded first on general economic forecasts of gross\nnational product, and then on special calculations applicable to the\nindustry and company in question.\nAn illustration of this method of valuation may be taken from\nour 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel. The\nValue Line, a leading investment service, makes forecasts of future\nearnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above, and then\nderives a figure of “price potentiality” (or projected market value)\nby applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer-\ntain past relationships. In Table 11-2 we reproduce the projections\nfor 1967–1969 made in June 1964, and compare them with the earn-\nings, and average market price actually realized in 1968 (which\napproximates the 1967–1969 period).\nThe combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side,\nbut not seriously so. The corresponding predictions made six years\nbefore had turned out to be overoptimistic on earnings and divi-\ndends; but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier, with the\nresult that the “price potentiality” figure proved to be about the\nsame as the actual average price for 1963.\nThe reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore-\ncasts were wide of the mark. This is an instance in support of our\ngeneral view that composite or group estimates are likely to be a\ngood deal more dependable than those for individual companies.\nIdeally, perhaps, the security analyst should pick out the three or\nfour companies whose future he thinks he knows the best, and con-\ncentrate his own and his clients’ interest on what he forecasts for\nwww.fx1618.com",

Unfortunately, it appears to be almost impossible to distin-\nguish in advance between those individual forecasts which can be\nrelied upon and those which are subject to a large chance of error.\nAt bottom, this is the reason for the wide diversification practiced\nby the investment funds. For it is undoubtedly better to concen-\ntrate on one stock that you knowis going to prove highly profitable,\nrather than dilute your results to a mediocre figure, merely for\ndiversification’s sake. But this is not done, because it cannot be\ndonedependably.4The prevalence of wide diversification is in itself\na pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of “selectivity,” to which Wall\nStreet constantly pays lip service.*\nFactors Affecting the Capitalization Rate\nThough average future earnings are supposed to be the chief\ndeterminant of value, the security analyst takes into account a\nnumber of other factors of a more or less definite nature.

Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do\nnot markedly outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder\nwhether the managers’ ideas are even worth having in the first place. For\nindisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification would\nbe foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a few great\nideas.

Let us deal briefly\nwith some of the considerations that enter into these divergent\nmultipliers.\n1. General Long-Term Prospects. No one really knows anything\nabout what will happen in the distant future, but analysts and\ninvestors have strong views on the subject just the same. These\nviews are reflected in the substantial differentials between the\nprice/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industry\ngroups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:\nFor example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the\nDJIAwere selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil\ncompanies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the\nformer than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are\noften soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor-\nmance they are as likely to be wrong as right.\nWe shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material\non the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their\nearnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-\nnies, despite their high multipliers, made practically no gain in\nearnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-\nter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in\ntheir 1963 multipliers.5Thus our chemical-stock example proved to\nbe one of the cases in which the market multipliers were proven\nwrong.*\n*Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to\nnearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall Street’s consensus\nview of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too\npessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its most cheery just when the\nstocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just when they are cheapest.\nThe most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications\nstocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999\nand early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002.

Until objective, quantita-\ntive, and reasonably reliable tests of managerial competence are\ndevised and applied, this factor will continue to be looked at\nthrough a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful\ncompany has unusually good management. This will have shown\nitself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-\nmates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-\ncussed factor of long-term prospects. The tendency to count it still\nanother time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to\nexpensive overvaluations. The management factor is most useful,\nwe think, in those cases in which a recent change has taken place\nthat has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual\nfigures.\nTwo spectacular occurrences of this kind were associated with\nthe Chrysler Motor Corporation. The first took place as far back as\n1921, when Walter Chrysler took command of the almost mori-\nbund Maxwell Motors, and in a few years made it a large and\nhighly profitable enterprise, while numerous other automobile\ncompanies were forced out of business. The second happened as\nrecently as 1962, when Chrysler had fallen far from its once high\nestate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.\nThen new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over\nthe reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per\nshare to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low\nof 381⁄ in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6\n2\n3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure. Stock of a company\nwith a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead of the common is\nclearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with\nthe same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi-\nties. Such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by\nsecurity analysts. A modest amount of bonds or preferred stock,\nperformance of 1) the market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) spe-\ncific stocks. As Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do\nany better are not good.

(Incidentally, a top-heavy\nstructure—too little common stock in relation to bonds and pre-\nferred—may under favorable conditions make for a huge specula-\ntiveprofit in the common. This is the factor known as “leverage.”)\n4.Dividend Record.One of the most persuasive tests of high qual-\nity is an uninterrupted record of dividend payments going back\nover many years. We think that a record of continuous dividend\npayments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor\nin the company’s quality rating. Indeed the defensive investor\nmight be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this\ntest.\n5. Current Dividend Rate. This, our last additional factor, is the\nmost difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,\nthe majority of companies have come to follow what may be called\na standard dividend policy. This has meant the distribution of\nabout two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent\nperiod of high profits and inflationary demands for more capital\nthe figure has tended to be lower. (In 1969 it was 59.5% for the\nstocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-\nrations.)* Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the\nearnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-\nstantially affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary\ncompany with expected average earnings of $3 and an expected\ndividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18\ntimes its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.\nHowever, an increasing number of growth companies are\ndeparting from the once standard policy of paying out 60% or\nmore of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-\n*This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has dropped consid-\nerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged investors from\nseeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of year-end 2002, the\npayout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S & P 500-stock index and, as recently\nas April 2000, it hit an all-time low of just 25.3%.

The issue presents problems and requires\ncareful distinctions. We have decided to defer our discussion of the\nvital question of proper dividend policy to a later section—Chapter\n19—where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of\nmanagement-shareholder relations.\nCapitalization Rates for Growth Stocks\nMost of the writing of security analysts on formal appraisals\nrelates to the valuation of growth stocks. Our study of the various\nmethods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple\nformula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to\nproduce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more\nrefined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:\nValue = Current (Normal) Earnings (cid:1)(8.5 plus twice\nthe expected annual growth rate)\nThe growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to\nten years.7\nIn Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various\nrates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-\ntion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-\nrent market price, assuming our formula is valid. In our last\nedition we made that calculation for the DJIAand for six important\nstock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-\nmented at the time:\nThe difference between the implicit 32.4% annual growth rate\nfor Xerox and the extremely modest 2.8% for General Motors is\nindeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market’s feel-\ning that General Motors’ 1963 earnings—the largest for any corpo-\nration in history—can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded\nonly modestly at best. The price earnings ratio of Xerox, on the\nother hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-\ntened upon a company of great achievement and perhaps still\ngreater promise.\nThe implicit or expected growth rate of 5.1% for the DJIAcom-\nwww.fx1618.com",

In fact, according to the arithmetic, if a company could be\nassumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitelyin the future its\nvalue would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for\nthe shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-\nduce a margin of safetyinto his calculations—somewhat as an engi-\nneer does in his specifications for a structure. On this basis the\npurchases would realize his assigned objective (in 1963, a future\noverall return of 71⁄% per annum) even if the growth rate actually\n2\nrealized proved substantially less than that projected in the for-\nmula. Of course, then, if that rate were actually realized the\ninvestor would be sure to enjoy a handsome additional return.\nThere is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with\nan expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in which the analyst\ncan make realistic assumptions of both the proper multiplier for\nthe current earnings and the expectable multiplier for the future\nearnings.\nAs it happened the actual growth for Xerox and IBM proved\nvery close to the high rates implied from our formula. As just\nexplained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance\nin the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIAitself was also\nabout as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-\nate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox\nand IBM. It turned out that the 23% price rise to the end of 1970,\nplus the 28% in aggregate dividend return received, gave not far\nfrom the 71⁄% annual overall gain posited in our formula. In the\n2\ncase of the other four companies it may suffice to say that their\ngrowth did not equal the expectations implied in the 1963 price\nand that their quotations failed to rise as much as the DJIA.

Hence we have retained our old formula above, sim-\nply because no new one would appear more plausible.\nIndustry Analysis\nBecause the general prospects of the enterprise carry major\nweight in the establishment of market prices, it is natural for the\nsecurity analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic\nposition of the industry and of the individual company in its\nindustry. Studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail. They are\nsometimes productive of valuable insights into important factors\nthat will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci-\nated by the current market.

By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount of money\ndoubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in just over 10 years.\nWhen interest rates are high, the amount of money you need to set aside\ntoday to reach a given value in the future is lower—since those high interest\nrates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate.

Wall\nStreet’s view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and this\nnecessarily applies to that important part of its investigations\nwhich is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in\nvarious industries.\nWe must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive\ngrowth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on\nthe attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than in\nthe past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the\ncoming decade may depend on its relation to new products and\nnew processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study and\nevaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for\neffective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with\nresearch men, and on intensive technological investigation on his\nown. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions\nderived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-\nported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhaps\nequal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober\ncalculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it\nboth ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits that\nare the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he\nmust run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he\ncan be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premium\nfor possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-\npared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.\nATwo-Part Appraisal Process\nLet us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal\nof a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. A\ngreat deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that\nthis better be done quite differently than is now the established\npractice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the\n“past-performance value,” which is based solely on the past\nrecord. This would indicate what the stock would be worth—\nabsolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIAor of the S & Pcompos-\nite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue\nwww.fx1618.com",

This process could be\ncarried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-\nual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,\nand also for current financial condition. The second part of the\nanalysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on\npast performance should be modified because of new conditions\nexpected in the future.\nSuch a procedure would divide the work between senior and\njunior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the\nformula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-\nperformance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up such\nfactors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanical\nfashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to what\nextent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely to\ndiffer from its past record, and what change should be made in\nthe value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the\nsenior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and the\nmodified one, with his reasons for the change.\nIs a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-\ntive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.\nWedoubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently\ndependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or\nsmall.

First, many security analysts are bound to make current or\nprojected valuations, as part of their daily work. The method we\npropose should be an improvement on those generally followed\ntoday. Secondly, because it should give useful experience and\ninsight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because\nwork of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded\nexperience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may lead\nto better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-\nsibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might well\nprove an important area in which this approach will show real\npragmatic value.

What makes this company grow? Where do (and where will) its\nprofits come from? Among the problems to watch for:\n• The company is a “serial acquirer.” An average of more than two\nor three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all,\nif the company itself would rather buy the stock of other busi-\nnesses than invest in its own, shouldn’t you take the hint and look\nelsewhere too? And check the company’s track record as an\nacquirer. Watch out for corporate bulimics—firms that wolf down\nbig acquisitions, only to end up vomiting them back out. Lucent,\nMattel, Quaker Oats, and Tyco International are among the com-\npanies that have had to disgorge acquisitions at sickening losses.\nOther firms take chronic write-offs, or accounting charges proving\nthat they overpaid for their past acquisitions. That’s a bad omen\nfor future deal making.3\n• The company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or selling stock\nto raise boatloads of Other People’s Money. These fat infusions of\nOPM are labeled “cash from financing activities” on the statement\nof cash flows in the annual report. They can make a sick company\nappear to be growing even if its underlying businesses are not\ngenerating enough cash—as Global Crossing and WorldCom\nshowed not long ago.4\n2You should also get at least one year’s worth of quarterly reports (on Form\n10-Q).

The prospectus revealed that one customer, Williams\nCommunications, accounted for 100% of Sycamore’s $11 million\nin total revenues. Traders blithely valued Sycamore’s shares at\n$15 billion. Unfortunately, Williams went bankrupt just over two\nyears later. Although Sycamore picked up other customers, its\nstock lost 97% between 2000 and 2002.\nAs you study the sources of growth and profit, stay on the lookout\nfor positives as well as negatives. Among the good signs:\n• The company has a wide “moat,” or competitive advantage. Like\ncastles, some companies can easily be stormed by marauding\ncompetitors, while others are almost impregnable. Several forces\ncan widen a company’s moat: a strong brand identity (think of\nHarley Davidson, whose buyers tattoo the company’s logo onto\ntheir bodies); a monopoly or near-monopoly on the market;\neconomies of scale,or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods\nor services cheaply (consider Gillette, which churns out razor\nblades by the billion); a unique intangible asset (think of Coca-\nCola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical\nvalue but maintains a priceless hold on consumers); a resistance\nto substitution(most businesses have no alternative to electricity,\nso utility companies are unlikely to be supplanted any time soon).5\ncompany’s cash inflows and outflows into “operating activities,” “invest-\ning activities,” and “financing activities.” If cash from operating activities is\nconsistently negative, while cash from financing activities is consistently\npositive, the company has a habit of craving more cash than its own\nbusinesses can produce—and you should not join the “enablers” of that\nhabitual abuse.

But the\n15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is\ndelusional.

No matter how good its products\nor how powerful its brands, a company must spend some money\nto develop new business.

The average budget\nfor research and development varies across industries and com-\npanies.

In this switcheroo, a company can-\ncels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employees\nand executives, then replaces them with new ones at advanta-\ngeous prices.

Any established company\nthat reprices options—as dozens of high-tech firms have—is a dis-\ngrace.

Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to\nproductive use. In the long run, companies that meet this definition are\nvirtually certain to grow in value, no matter what the stock market\ndoes.\nStart by reading the statement of cash flows in the company’s\nannual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily\nthroughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further. Warren Buffett\nhas popularized the concept of owner earnings, or net income plus\namortization and depreciation, minus normal capital expenditures. As\nportfolio manager Christopher Davis of Davis Selected Advisors puts\nit, “If you owned 100% of this business, how much cash would you\nhave in your pocket at the end of the year?” Because it adjusts for\naccounting entries like amortization and depreciation that do not\naffect the company’s cash balances, owner earnings can be a better\nmeasure than reported net income. To fine-tune the definition of owner\nearnings, you should also subtract from reported net income:\n• any costs of granting stock options, which divert earnings away\nfrom existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners\n• any “unusual,” “nonrecurring,” or “extraordinary” charges\n• any “income” from the company’s pension fund.\nIf owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at\nleast 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable gen-\nerator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.\nNext, look at the company’s capital structure. Turn to the balance\nsheet to see how much debt (including preferred stock) the company\nhas; in general, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital.\nIn the footnotes to the financial statements, determine whether the\nlong-term debt is fixed-rate (with constant interest payments) or vari-\nable (with payments that fluctuate, which could become costly if inter-\nest rates rise).\nLook in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the\n“ratio of earnings to fixed charges.” That exhibit to Amazon.com’s\n2002 annual report shows that Amazon’s earnings fell $145 million\nshort of covering its interest costs.

If the firm has consistently outper-\nformed the competition in good markets and bad, the managers are\nclearly putting the cash to optimal use.

Two shares of a stock at $50 are not worth\nmore than one share at $100.

And, in earlier days, a\ncompany that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-\nible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have “watered”\nits stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market\nmanipulator Daniel Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He\nwould drive his cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt\nalong the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge\nvolumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,\nwhere the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That\nenabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by\nthe pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively\nissuing new shares without warning.\n†Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant Italian\nstone carvers who ornamented the otherwise plain facades of buildings\nthroughout New York in the early 1900s.

The\ndeductions came from four sources, viz.:\n1. Management’s estimate of the anticipated costs of closing\ndown the manufactured products division.\n2. Ditto for closing down ALCOACastings Co.’s plants.\n3. Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOACredit Co.\n4. Also, estimated costs of $5.3 million associated with comple-\ntion of the contract for a “curtain wall.”\nAll of these items are related to future costs and losses.

Awidespread enterprise\nsuch as ALCOA, doing a $1.5 billion business annually, must have\na lot of divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not\nbe normal rather than extraordinary for one or more to prove\nunprofitable, and to require closing down? Similarly for such\nthings as a contract to build a wall. Suppose that any time a com-\npany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of\ncharging it off as a “special item,” and thus reporting its “primary\nearnings” per share so as to include only its profitable contracts\nand operations? Like King Edward VII’s sundial, that marked only\nthe “sunny hours.”*\n*The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay by the\nEnglish writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near Venice that\nbore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas,or “I count only the hours\nthat are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad news from their\nfinancial results on the pretext that negative events are “extraordinary” or\n“nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt, who urged his readers “to\ntake no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and ne-\nglect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments,\nturning away to the sunny side of things, and letting the rest slip from our\nimaginations, unheeded or forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.\n1827.)

      "text": "314 The Intelligent Investor\nThe reader should note two ingenious aspects of the ALCOA\nprocedure we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating\nfuture losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the\nlosses themselves to an identifiable year. They don’t belong in\n1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they\nwon’t be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because\nthey have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not\nbe just a little misleading?\nThe ALCOAfootnote says nothing about the future tax saving\nfrom these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-\ncally that only the “after-tax effect” has been charged off.) If the\nALCOAfigure represents future losses before the related tax credit,\nthen not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these\ncharges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increasedby\na tax credit of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the\naccounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-\npanies which have had large losses in the past have been able to\nreport future earnings without charging the normal taxes against\nthem, in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed—\nbased paradoxically enough on their past disgraces. (Tax credits\nresulting from past years’losses are now being shown separately as\n“special items,” but they will enter into future statistics as part of\nthe final “net-income” figure. However, a reserve now set up for\nfuturelosses, if netof expected tax credit, should not create an addi-\ntion of this sort to the net income of later years.)\nThe other ingenious feature is the use by ALCOA and many\nother companies of the 1970 year-end for making these special\ncharge-offs. The stock market took what appeared to be a blood\nbath in the first half of 1970. Everyone expected relatively poor\nresults for the year for most companies. Wall Street was now antic-\nipating better results in 1971, 1972, etc. What a nice arrangement,\nthen, to charge as much as possible to the bad year, which had\nalready been written off mentally and had virtually receded into\nthe past, leaving the way clear for nicely fattened figures in the\nnext few years! Perhaps this is good accounting, good business pol-\nicy, and good for management-shareholder relationships.

The underlying idea was to\nequalize the reported earnings, more or less, and to improve the\nstability factor in the company’s record. Aworthy motive, it would\nseem; but the accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as\nmisstating the true earnings. They insisted that each year’s results\nbe presented as they were, good or bad, and the shareholders and\nanalysts be allowed to do the averaging or equalizing for them-\nselves. We seem now to be witnessing the opposite phenomenon,\nwith everyone charging off as much as possible against forgotten\n1970, so as to start 1971 with a slate not only clean but specially\nprepared to show pleasing per-share figures in the coming years.\nIt is time to return to our first question. What then were the true\nearnings of ALCOAin 1970? The accurate answer would be: The\n$5.01 per share, after “dilution,” less that part of the 82 cents of\n“special charges” that may properly be attributed to occurrences in\n1970. But we do not know what that portion is, and hence we cannot\nproperly state the true earnings for the year.The management and the\nauditors should have given us their best judgment on this point,\nbut they did not do so.

This evidently they will not\ndo either, since they have already conveniently disposed of the\nentire sum as a 1970 special charge.\nThe more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures\nas published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard\nagainst accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair\nthe true comparability of the numbers. We have mentioned three\nsorts of these factors: the use of special charges,which may never be\nreflected in the per-share earnings, the reduction in the normal\nincome-tax deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution fac-\ntor implicit in the existence of substantial amounts of convertible\nsecurities or warrants.1 A fourth item that has had a significant\neffect on reported earnings in the past is the method of treating\ndepreciation—chiefly as between the “straight-line” and the\n“accelerated” schedules. We refrain from details here. But as an\nexample current as we write, let us mention the 1970 report of\nTrane Co. This firm showed an increase of nearly 20% in per-share\nearnings over 1969—$3.29 versus $2.76—but half of this came from\nreturning to the older straight-line depreciation rates, less burden-\nsome on earnings than the accelerated method used the year\nbefore. (The company will continue to use the accelerated rate on\nits income-tax return, thus deferring income-tax payments on the\ndifference.) Still another factor, important at times, is the choice\nbetween charging off research and development costs in the year\nthey are incurred or amortizing them over a period of years.\nFinally, let us mention the choice between the FIFO (first-in-first-\nout) and LIFO (last-in-first-out) methods of valuing inventories.*\n*Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting fac-\ntors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as if” finan-\ncial statements, which report a company’s earnings as if Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another is the dilu-\ntive effect of issuing millions of stock options for executive compensation,\nthen buying back millions of shares to keep those options from reducing the\nvalue of the common stock.

But Wall Street being as it is, even items quite\nminor in themselves can be taken seriously. Two days before the\nALCOAreport appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the paper had\nquite a discussion of the corresponding statement of Dow Chemi-\ncal. It closed with the observation that “many analysts” had been\ntroubled by the fact that Dow had included a 21-cent item in regu-\nlar profits for 1969, instead of treating it as an item of “extraordi-\nnary income.” Why the fuss? Because, evidently, evaluations of\nDow Chemical involving many millions of dollars in the aggregate\nseemed to depend on exactly what was the percentage gain for\n1969 over 1968—in this case either 9% or 41⁄%. This strikes us\n2\nas rather absurd; it is very unlikely that small differences involved\nin one year’s results could have any bearing on future average\nprofits or growth, and on a conservative, realistic valuation of the\nenterprise.\nBy contrast, consider another statement also appearing in Janu-\nary 1971. This concerned Northwest Industries Inc.’s report for\n1970.* The company was planning to write off, as a special charge,\nnot less than $264 million in one fell swoop. Of this, $200 million\nrepresents the loss to be taken on the proposed sale of the railroad\nsubsidiary to its employees and the balance a write-down of a\nrecent stock purchase. These sums would work out to a loss of\nabout $35 per share of common before dilution offsets, or twice its\nthen current market price. Here we have something really signifi-\npany and thus “remove” those financial risks from the company’s balance\nsheet. Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other\n“soft” costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of\ndoing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary\nthat accompanies this chapter.\n*Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other busi-\nnesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear\n(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs).

If the transaction goes through, and if the tax laws are not\nchanged, this loss provided for in 1970 will permit Northwest\nIndustries to realize about $400 million of future profits (within\nfive years) from its other diversified interests without paying\nincome tax thereon.* What will then be the real earnings of that\nenterprise; should they be calculated with or without provision for\nthe nearly 50% in income taxes which it will not actually have to\npay? In our opinion, the proper mode of calculation would be first\nto consider the indicated earning power on the basis of full income-\ntax liability, and to derive some broad idea of the stock’s value\nbased on that estimate. To this should be added some bonus figure,\nrepresenting the value per share of the important but temporary\ntax exemption the company will enjoy.

As the tax code now\nstands, these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing the\ncompany’s tax liability for the entire period (and thus raising its earnings\nafter tax). Therefore, investors should consider whether recent severe\nlosses could actually improvethe company’s net earnings in the future.\n†Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of\nthem frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional\ncases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the\ntime, the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden-\ntical.

This “mean figure”* was useful for\nironing out the frequent ups and downs of the business cycle, and\nit was thought to give a better idea of the company’s earning\npower than the results of the latest year alone. One important\nadvantage of such an averaging process is that it will solve the\nproblem of what to do about nearly all the special charges and\ncredits. They should be included in the average earnings. For cer-\ntainly most of these losses and gains represent a part of the\ncompany’s operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average\nearnings for 1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as $3.62 and for\nthe seven years 1964–1970 as $4.62 per share. If such figures are\nused in conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earn-\nings during the same period, they could give a really informing\npicture of the company’s past performance.\nCalculation of the Past Growth Rate\nIt is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company’s\nrecord be taken adequately into account. Where the growth has\nbeen large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-\nyear average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel-\nevant. This need not be the case. The earnings can be given in\ntermsbothof the average and the latest figure. We suggest that the\ngrowth rate itself be calculated by comparing the averageof the last\nthree years with corresponding figures ten years earlier. (Where\nthere is a problem of “special charges or credits” it may be dealt\nwith on some compromise basis.) Note the following calculation\nfor the growth of ALCOAas against that of Sears Roebuck and the\nDJIAgroup as a whole.\nComment:These few figures could be made the subject of a long\ndiscussion.

All information on Qwest is taken from its financial filings with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (annual report, Form 8K, and\nForm 10-K) found in the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. No hindsight\nwas required to detect the “change in accounting principle,” which Qwest\nfully disclosed at the time. How did Qwest’s shares do over this period? At\nyear-end 2000, the stock had been at $41 per share, a total market value of\n$67.9 billion. By early 2003, Qwest was around $4, valuing the entire com-\npany at less than $7 billion—a 90% loss. The drop in share price is not the\nonly cost associated with bogus earnings; a recent study found that a sam-\nple of 27 firms accused of accounting fraud by the SEC had overpaid $320\nmillion in Federal income tax. Although much of that money will eventually be\nrefunded by the IRS, most shareholders are unlikely to stick around to bene-\nfit from the refunds.

After wiring\nthe world, Global Crossing would sell other communications compa-\nnies the right to carry their traffic over its network of cables. In 1998\nalone, Global Crossing spent more than $600 million to construct its\noptical web. That year, nearly a third of the construction budget was\ncharged against revenues as an expense called “cost of capacity\nsold.” If not for that $178 million expense, Global Crossing—which\nreported a net loss of $96 million—could have reported a net profit of\nroughly $82 million.\nThe next year, says a bland footnote in the 1999 annual report,\nGlobal Crossing “initiated service contract accounting.” The company\nwould no longer charge most construction costs as expenses against\nthe immediate revenues it received from selling capacity on its net-\nwork. Instead, a major chunk of those construction costs would now\nbe treated not as an operating expense but as a capital expenditure—\nthereby increasing the company’s total assets, instead of decreasing\nits net income.4\nPoof!

But Global Crossing did not book most of the revenues up front,\ninstead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease. Now, however, because\nthe networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25 years, Global Cross-\ning began treating them as depreciable, long-lived capital assets. While this\ntreatment conforms with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, it is\nunclear why Global Crossing did not use it before October 1, 1999, or what\nexactly prompted the change.

Was the devaluation of Micron’s inventory a\nnonrecurring event, or had it become a chronic condition? Reason-\nable minds can differ on this particular case, but one thing is clear:\nThe intelligent investor must always be on guard for “nonrecurring”\ncosts that, like the Energizer bunny, just keep on going.5\nTHE PENSION DIMENSION\nIn 2001, SBC Communications, Inc., which owns interests in Cingular\nWireless, PacTel, and Southern New England Telephone, earned $7.2\nbillion in net income—a stellar performance in a bad year for the\noverextended telecom industry. But that gain didn’t come only from\nSBC’s business. Fully $1.4 billion of it—13% of the company’s net\nincome—came from SBC’s pension plan.\nBecause SBC had more money in the pension plan than it esti-\nmated was necessary to pay its employees’ future benefits, the com-\npany got to treat the difference as current income. One simple reason\nfor that surplus: In 2001, SBC raised the rate of return it expected to\nearn on the pension plan’s investments from 8.5% to 9.5%—lowering\nthe amount of money it needed to set aside today.\nSBC explained its rosy new expectations by noting that “for each\nof the three years ended 2001, our actual 10-year return on invest-\nments exceeded 10%.” In other words, our past returns have been\nhigh, so let’s assume that our future returns will be too. But that not\nonly flunked the most rudimentary tests of logic, it flew in the face of\nthe fact that interest rates were falling to near-record lows, depressing\nthe future returns on the bond portion of a pension portfolio.\nThe same year, in fact, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway low-\nered the expected rate of return on its pension assets from 8.3% to\n6.5%. Was SBC being realistic in assuming that its pension-fund man-\nagers could significantly outperform the world’s greatest investor?\nProbably not: In 2001, Berkshire Hathaway’s pension fund gained\n9.8%, but SBC’s pension fund lost 6.9%.6\n5I am grateful to Howard Schilit and Mark Hamel of the Center for Financial\nResearch and Analysis for providing this example.\n6Returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan assets at\nthe bwegwinnwing. foxf 1th6e y1e8ar .bcyo “amctual return on plan assets.”",

There should be sufficient variety in the financial and\noperating data to make the examination of interest.\nIn Table 13-1 we present a summary of what the four companies\nwere selling for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures\non their 1970 operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which\nrelate on the one hand to performance and on the other to price.\nComment is called for on how various aspects of the performance\npattern agree with the relative price pattern.

(a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings\non their book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are\nmuch higher than for the other two. A high rate of return on\ninvested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in\nearnings per share.* All the companies except Emery showed bet-\nter earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery fig-\nure was exceptionally large in both years. (b) For manufacturing\ncompanies, the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica-\ntion of comparative strength or weakness. We use here the “ratio of\noperating income to sales,” as given in Standard & Poor’s Listed\nStock Reports. Here again the results are satisfactory for all four\ncompanies, with an especially impressive showing by Emerson.\nThe changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the\ncompanies.\n2. Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-\nshare earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the aver-\nage of the three preceding years. No decline translates into 100%\nstability, and this was registered by the two popular concerns. But\nthe shrinkages of eltra and Emhart were quite moderate in the\n“poor year” 1970, amounting to only 8% each by our measurement,\nagainst 7% for the DJIA.\n3. Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satis-\nfactory growth rates, in both cases doing better than the Dow Jones\ngroup. The eltra figures are especially impressive when set\nagainst its low price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more\nimpressive for the high-multiplier pair.\n4. Financial Position.

In\nour analysis we have made allowance for the dilution factor in\nthe usual way by treating the preferred as if converted into com-\nmon. This decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents per share, or\nsome 4%.\n5. Dividends. What really counts is the history of continuance\nwithout interruption. The best record here is Emhart’s, which has\nnot suspended a payment since 1902. eltra’srecord is very good,\nEmerson’s quite satisfactory, Emery Freight is a newcomer. The\nvariations in payout percentage do not seem especially significant.\nThe current dividend yield is twice as high on the “cheap pair” as\non the “dear pair,” corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.\n6.Price History.The reader should be impressed by the percent-\nage advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as mea-\nsured from the lowest to the highest points during the past 34\nyears. (In all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent\nstock splits.) Note that for the DJIAthe range from low to high was\non the order of 11 to 1; for our companies the spread has varied\nfrom “only” 17 to 1 for Emhart to no less than 528 to 1 for Emery\nAir Freight.* These manifold price advances are characteristic of\nmost of our older common-stock issues, and they proclaim the\ngreat opportunities of profit that have existed in the stock markets\nof the past. (But they may indicate also how overdone were the\ndeclines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were\nregistered.) Both eltra and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of\nmore than 50% in the 1969–70 price break. Emerson and Emery had\nserious, but less distressing, declines; the former rebounded to a\nnew all-time high before the end of 1970, the latter in early 1971.\n*In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and dividing\nthe high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price.

Afinancial analyst blessed (or\nhandicapped) with a good memory will think of an analogy\nbetween Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would not be\nreassuring. For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for many\nyears; it too sold in the market for $1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof-\nits fell from $43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in\nthat year’s big selloff its price declined to 221⁄ against the previous\n2\ntop of 89.

But these fig-\nures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they\nstarted quite small, at only $570,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often\nproves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after\nvolume and profits have already expanded to big totals. The most\nsurprising aspect of Emery’s story is that its earnings and market\nprice continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year in\nthe domestic air-passenger industry. This is a remarkable achieve-\nment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits may\nnot be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-\npetition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air-\nlines, etc. An elaborate study might be needed before a sound\njudgment could be passed on these points, but the conservative\ninvestor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.\nEmhartandeltra.

The shares are worth holding (at 34).”\nConclusions: Many financial analysts will find Emerson and\nEmery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—\nprimarily, perhaps, because of their better “market action,” and\nsecondarily because of their faster recent growth in earnings.\nUnder our principles of conservative investment the first is not a\nvalid reason for selection—that is something for the speculators to\nplay around with. The second has validity, but within limits. Can\nthe past growth and the presumably good prospects of Emery Air\nFreight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings?1Our\nanswer would be: Maybe for someone who has made an in-depth\nstudy of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep-\ntionally firm and optimistic conclusions. But not for the careful\ninvestor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he is not\ncommitting the typical Wall Street error of overenthusiasm for\ngood performance in earnings and in the stock market.* The same\n*Graham was right.

With its base in Old Econ-\nomy industries, Emerson looked boring in the late 1990s. (In the Inter-\nnet Age, who cared about Emerson’s heavy-duty wet-dry vacuums?)\nThe company’s shares went into suspended animation. In 1998 and\n1999, Emerson’s stock lagged the S & P 500 index by a cumulative\n49.7 percentage points, a miserable underperformance.\nBut that was Emerson the stock. What about Emerson the com-\npany? In 1999, Emerson sold $14.4 billion worth of goods and ser-\nvices, up nearly $1 billion from the year before. On those revenues\nEmerson earned $1.3 billion in net income, or 6.9% more than in\n1998. Over the previous five years, earnings per share had risen at a\nrobust average rate of 8.3%. Emerson’s dividend had more than dou-\nbled to $1.30 per share; book value had gone from $6.69 to $14.27\nper share. According to Value Line, throughout the 1990s, Emerson’s\nnet profit margin and return on capital—key measures of its efficiency\nas a business—had stayed robustly high, around 9% and 18% respec-\ntively. What’s more, Emerson had increased its earnings for 42 years\nin a row and had raised its dividend for 43 straight years—one of the\nlongest runs of steady growth in American business. At year-end,\nEmerson’s stock was priced at 17.7 times the company’s net income\nper share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never flashy, but it was\nreliable—and showed no sign of overheating.\nCOULD EMC GROW PDQ?\nEMC Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s,\nrising—or should we say levitating?—more than 81,000%. If you had\ninvested $10,000 in EMC’s stock at the beginning of 1990, you\nwould have ended 1999 with just over $8.1 million. EMC’s shares\nreturned 157.1% in 1999 alone—more than Emerson’s stock had\ngained in the eight years from 1992 through 1999 combined. EMC\nhad never paid a dividend, instead retaining all its earnings “to provide\nfunds for the continued growth of the company.”1 At their December\n1As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in practice, “to pro-\nvide funds for the continued growth of the company’s top managers’ wealth.”\nwww.fx1618.com",

Revenues grew 24% in 1999, ris-\ning to $6.7 billion. Its earnings per share soared to 92 cents from 61\ncents the year before, a 51% increase. Over the five years ending in\n1999, EMC’s earnings had risen at a sizzling annual rate of 28.8%.\nAnd, with everyone expecting the tidal wave of Internet commerce to\nkeep rolling, the future looked even brighter. Throughout 1999, EMC’s\nchief executive repeatedly predicted that revenues would hit $10 bil-\nlion by 2001—up from $5.4 billion in 1998.2 That would require aver-\nage annual growth of 23%, a monstrous rate of expansion for so big a\ncompany. But Wall Street’s analysts, and most investors, were sure\nEMC could do it. After all, over the previous five years, EMC had more\nthan doubled its revenues and better than tripled its net income.\nBut from 1995 through 1999, according to Value Line, EMC’s net\nprofit margin slid from 19.0% to 17.4%, while its return on capital\ndropped from 26.8% to 21%. Although still highly profitable, EMC\nwas already slipping. And in October 1999, EMC acquired Data Gen-\neral Corp., which added roughly $1.1 billion to EMC’s revenues that\nyear. Simply by subtracting the extra revenues brought in from Data\nGeneral, we can see that the volume of EMC’s existing businesses\ngrew from $5.4 billion in 1998 to just $5.6 billion in 1999, a rise of\nonly 3.6%. In other words, EMC’s true growth rate was almost nil—\neven in a year when the scare over the “Y2K” computer bug had led\nmany companies to spend record amounts on new technology.3\n2Appearing on CNBC on December 30, 1999, EMC’s chief executive,\nMichael Ruettgers, was asked by host Ron Insana whether “2000 and\nbeyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like it’s\naccelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock was\novervalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the opportunity\nwe have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited....So while it’s hard to predict\nwhether these things are overpriced, there’s such a major change taking\nplace that if you could find the winners today—and I certainly think EMC is\none of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in the future.”\n3The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that millions of\ncomputers worldwide would stop functioning at one second past midnight\nwww.fx1618.com",

In a 2-for-1 stock split, a company doubles the\nnumber of its shares and halves their price—so a shareholder ends up\nowning twice as many shares, each priced at half the former level.\nWhat’s so great about that? Imagine that you handed me a dime, and\nI then gave you back two nickels and asked, “Don’t you feel richer\nnow?” You would probably conclude either that I was an idiot, or that I\nhad mistaken you for one. And yet, in 1999’s frenzy over dot-com\nstocks, online traders acted exactly as if two nickels were more valu-\nable than one dime. In fact, just the news that a stock would be split-\nting 2-for-1 could instantly drive its shares up 20% or more.\nWhy? Because getting more shares makes people feel richer.\nSomeone who bought 100 shares of Exodus in January watched them\nturn into 200 when the stock split in April; then those 200 turned into\n400 in August; then the 400 became 800 in December.

To them, that felt like “found money”—\nnever mind that the price per share had been cut in half with each\nsplit.4 In December, 1999, one elated Exodus shareholder, who went\nby the handle “givemeadollar,” exulted on an online message board:\n“I’m going to hold these shares until I’m 80, [because] after it splits\nhundreds of times over the next years, I’ll be close to becoming\nCEO.”5\nWhat about Exodus the business?

Since we have already described in general terms\nthe investment policies recommended for our two categories of\ninvestors,* it would be logical for us now to indicate how security\nanalysis comes into play in order to implement these policies. The\ndefensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only\nhigh-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks.\nHe is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is\nnot unduly high as judged by applicable standards.\nIn setting up this diversified list he has a choice of two\napproaches, the DJIA-type of portfolio and the quantitatively-\ntested portfolio. In the first he acquires a true cross-section sample\nof the leading issues, which will include both some favored growth\ncompanies, whose shares sell at especially high multipliers, and\nalso less popular and less expensive enterprises. This could be\ndone, most simply perhaps, by buying the same amounts of all\nthirty of the issues in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Ten\nshares of each, at the 900 level for the average, would cost an\naggregate of about $16,000.1 On the basis of the past record he\nmight expect approximately the same future results by buying\nshares of several representative investment funds.†\nHis second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each\n*Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters 4\nthrough 7.\n†As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9, today’s\ndefensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a low-cost index\nfund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total U.S. stock market.\nwww.fx1618.com\n347",

At the close of the previous chapter we\nlisted seven such quality and quantity criteria suggested for the\nselection of specific common stocks. Let us describe them in order.\n1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise\nAll our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the\nmatter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies\nwhich may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially\nin the industrial field. (There are often good possibilities in such\nenterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the\ndefensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than $100\nmillion of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than\n$50 million of total assets for a public utility.\n2. ASufficiently Strong Financial Condition\nFor industrial companies current assets should be at least twice\ncurrent liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also, long-\nterm debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working\ncapital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the\nstock equity (at book value).\n3. Earnings Stability\nSome earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten\nyears.\n4. Dividend Record\nUninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.\n5. Earnings Growth\nAminimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings\nin the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning\nand end.\nwww.fx1618.com",

      "text": "Stock Selection for the DefensiveInvestor 349\n6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio\nCurrent price should not be more than 15 times average earn-\nings of the past three years.\n7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets\nCurrent price should not be more than 11⁄ times the book value last\n2\nreported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a\ncorrespondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we\nsuggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to\nbook value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15\ntimes earnings and 11⁄ times book value. It would admit an issue sell-\n2\ning at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)\nGeneral Comments: These requirements are set up especially\nfor the needs and the temperament of defensive investors. They\nwill eliminate the great majority of common stocks as candidates\nfor the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand they\nwill exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak\nfinancial condition, (3) with a deficit stigma in their ten-year\nrecord, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.\nOf these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are\nthose of financial strength. Aconsiderable number of our large and\nformerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-\nrent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.\nOur last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by\ndemanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than\nthe popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standard\nviewpoint of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even\nconservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices\nfor stocks of the choice companies. We have expounded our con-\ntrary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-\ntor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on\never-increasing earnings in the future. The reader will have to\ndecide this important question for himself—after weighing the\narguments on both sides.\nWe have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest\nrequirement of growth over the past decade. Without it the typical\ncompany would show retrogression, at least in terms of profit per\nwww.fx1618.com",

There is no reason for the defensive\ninvestor to include such companies—though if the price is low\nenough they could qualify as bargain opportunities.\nThe suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well\nresult in a typical portfolio with an averagemultiplier of, say, 12 to\n13 times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. & Tel. sold at 11\ntimes its three-year (and current) earnings, and Standard Oil of\nCalifornia at less than 10 times latest earnings. Our basic recom-\nmendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have\nan overall earnings/price ratio—the reverse of the P/E ratio—at\nleast as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean\na P/E ratio no higher than 13.3 against an AAbond yield of 7.5%.*\nApplication of Our Criteria to the DJIAat the End of 1970\nAll of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIAissues at\nthe end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based\non the closing price of 1970 and the relevant figures. (The basic\ndata for each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)\n1. Size is more than ample for each company.\n2. Financial condition is adequate in the aggregate, but not for\nevery company.2\n3. Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least\n1940. Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.\n*In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was around\n4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio should have\nan earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the inverse of that num-\nber (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a “suggested maximum” P/E\nratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this paragraph Graham recommends that\nthe “average” stock be priced about 20% below the “maximum” ratio. That\nsuggests that—in general—Graham would consider stocks selling at no more\nthan 17 times their three-year average earnings to be potentially attractive\ngiven today’s interest rates and market conditions. As of December 31,\n2002, more than 200—or better than 40%—of the stocks in the S & P 500-\nstock index had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower.

We exclude one crite-\nrion from our tests of public-utility stocks—namely, the ratio of\ncurrent assets to current liabilities. The working-capital factor takes\ncare of itself in this industry as part of the continuous financing of\nits growth by sales of bonds and shares. We do require an adequate\nproportion of stock capital to debt.4\nIn Table 14-4 we present a résumé of the 15 issues in the Dow\nJones public-utility average. For comparison, Table 14-5 gives a\nsimilar picture of a random selection of fifteen other utilities taken\nfrom the New York Stock Exchange list.\nAs 1972 began the defensive investor could have had quite a\nwide choice of utility common stocks, each of which would have\nmet our requirements for both performance and price. These com-\npanies offered him everything he had a right to demand from\nsimply chosen common-stock investments. In comparison with\nprominent industrial companies as represented by the DJIA, they\noffered almost as good a record of past growth, plus smaller fluctu-\nations in the annual figures—both at a lower price in relation to\nearnings and assets. The dividend return was significantly higher.\nThe position of the utilities as regulated monopolies is assuredly\nmore of an advantage than a disadvantage for the conservative\ninvestor. Under law they are entitled to charge rates sufficiently\nremunerative to attract the capital they need for their continuous\nexpansion, and this implies adequate offsets to inflated costs.\nWhile the process of regulation has often been cumbersome and\nperhaps dilatory, it has not prevented the utilities from earning a\nfair return on their rising invested capital over many decades.\nceled and decommissioned nuclear energy plants; nor did he foresee the\nconsequences of bungled regulation in California. Utility stocks are vastly\nmore volatile than they were in Graham’s day, and most investors should\nown them only through a well-diversified, low-cost fund like the Dow Jones\nU.S. Utilities Sector Index Fund (ticker symbol: IDU) or Utilities Select Sec-\ntor SPDR (XLU).

This,\nin turn, has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervi-\nsion, with the design and general result of assuring against\nunsound financial practices.\nBroadly speaking, the shares of financial concerns have pro-\nduced investment results similar to those of other types of common\nshares.

More than half\nof the railroad mileage of the country has been in bankruptcy (or\n“trusteeship”) at various times during the past 50 years.\nBut this half-century has not been all downhill for the carriers.\nThere have been prosperous periods for the industry, especially the\nwar years. Some of the lines have managed to maintain their earn-\ning power and their dividends despite the general difficulties.\nThe Standard & Poor’s index advanced sevenfold from the low\nof 1942 to the high of 1968, not much below the percentage gain in\nthe public-utility index. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Trans-\nportation Co., our most important railroad, in 1970 shocked the\nfinancial world.

Hence the reader will ask whether, if he gets him-\nself a competent adviser or security analyst, he should not be able to\ncount on being supplied with an investment package of really supe-\nrior merits. “After all,” he may say, “the rules you have outlined are\npretty simple and easygoing. Ahighly trained analyst ought to be\nable to use all his skill and techniques to improve substantially on\nsomething as obvious as the Dow Jones list. If not, what good are all\nhis statistics, calculations, and pontifical judgments?”\nSuppose, as a practical test, we had asked a hundred security\nanalysts to choose the “best” five stocks in the Dow Jones Average,\nto be bought at the end of 1970. Few would have come up with\nidentical choices and many of the lists would have differed com-\npletely from each other.\nThis is not so surprising as it may at first appear. The underlying\nreason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well\nreflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general\nopinion as to its future prospects. Hence the view of any analyst that\none stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent\nfrom his personal partialities and expectations, or from the placing\nof his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his\nwork of evaluation. If all analysts were agreed that one particular\nstock was better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance\nto a price which would offset all of its previous advantages.*\n*Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH, an aca-\ndemic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly\navailable information about the company. With millions of investors scouring\nthe market every day, it is unlikely that severe mispricings can persist for\nlong. An old joke has two finance professors walking along the sidewalk;\nwhen one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his\narm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have\ntaken it already.” While the market is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close\nmost of the time—so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock\nmarket’s $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the\ncosts of trading and taxes.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Corresponding with these two kinds\nof value elements are two basically different approaches to security\nanalysis. To be sure, every competent analyst looks forward to the\nfuture rather than backward to the past, and he realizes that his\nwork will prove good or bad depending on what willhappen and\nnot on what has happened. Nevertheless, the future itself can be\napproached in two different ways, which may be called the way of\nprediction(or projection) and the way of protection.*\nThose who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate\nfairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future\nyears—in particular whether earnings will show pronounced and\npersistent growth. These conclusions may be based on a very care-\nful study of such factors as supply and demand in the industry—or\nvolume, price, and costs—or else they may be derived from a\nrather naïve projection of the line of past growth into the future. If\nthese authorities are convinced that the fairly long-term prospects\nare unusually favorable, they will almost always recommend the\nstock for purchase without paying too much regard to the level at\nwhich it is selling. Such, for example, was the general attitude with\nrespect to the air-transport stocks—an attitude that persisted for\nmany years despite the distressingly bad results often shown after\n1946. In the Introduction we have commented on the disparity\nbetween the strong price action and the relatively disappointing\nearnings record of this industry.\n*This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors labor\nunder a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for the future.\nAnd, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain. Inflation and inter-\nest rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;\ngeopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages, and terrorism arrive\nwithout warning; and the fate of individual companies and their industries\noften turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,\ninvesting on the basis of projectionis a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of\nthe so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-\nple, investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and\nfrom overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best solu-\ntion.

Generally\nspeaking, therefore, it is not so necessary for them to be enthusias-\ntic over the company’s long-run prospects as it is to be reasonably\nconfident that the enterprise will get along.\nThe first, or predictive, approach could also be called the quali-\ntative approach, since it emphasizes prospects, management, and\nother nonmeasurable, albeit highly important, factors that go\nunder the heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach\nmay be called the quantitative or statistical approach, since it\nemphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and\nearnings, assets, dividends, and so forth. Incidentally, the quantita-\ntive method is really an extension—into the field of common\nstocks—of the viewpoint that security analysis has found to be\nsound in the selection of bonds and preferred stocks for invest-\nment.\nIn our own attitude and professional work we were always\ncommitted to the quantitative approach. From the first we wanted\nto make sure that we were getting ample value for our money in\nconcrete, demonstrable terms. We were not willing to accept the\nprospects and promises of the future as compensation for a lack of\nsufficient value in hand.

Gra-\nham suggests that the defensive investor can, “most simply,” buy every\nstock in the DowJones Industrial Average. Today’s defensive investor\ncan do even better—by buying a total stock-market index fund that\nholds essentially every stock worth having. A low-cost index fund is\nthe best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing—and\nany effort to improve on it takes more work (and incurs more risk and\nhigher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify.\nResearching and selecting your own stocks is not necessary; for\nmost people, it is not even advisable. However, some defensive\ninvestors do enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking\nindividual stocks—and, if you have survived a bear market and still\nenjoy stock picking, then nothing that Graham or I could say will dis-\nsuade you. In that case, instead of making a total stock market index\nfund your complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio.\nOnce you have that foundation in place, you can experiment around\nthe edges with your own stock choices. Keep 90% of your stock\nmoney in an index fund, leaving 10% with which to try picking your\nown stocks. Only after you build that solid core should you explore.\n(To learn why such broad diversification is so important, please see\nthe sidebar on the following page.)\nwww.fx1618.com\n367",

After all, if you could identify the next Microsoft,\nwouldn’t it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one\nbasket?\nWell, sure. As the humorist Will Rogers once said, “Don’t\ngamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock and\nhold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”\nHowever, as Rogers knew, 20/20 foresight is not a gift\ngranted to most investors.

But here, it seems, Graham set a very low\nhurdle; 33% cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3% aver-\nage annual increase.

Incredibly, the prevailing practice on Wall\nStreet today is to value stocks by dividing their current price by some-\nthing called “next year’s earnings.” That gives what is sometimes\ncalled “the forward P/E ratio.” But it’s nonsensical to derive a\nprice/earnings ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown\nfuture earnings. Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has\nshown, 59% of Wall Street’s “consensus” earnings forecasts miss the\nmark by a mortifyingly wide margin—either underestimating or overesti-\nmating the actual reported earnings by at least 15%.2 Investing your\nmoney on the basis of what these myopic soothsayers predict for the\ncoming year is as risky as volunteering to hold up the bulls-eye at an\narchery tournament for the legally blind.

Graham recommends a “ratio of\nprice to assets” (or price-to-book-value ratio) of no more than 1.5. In\nrecent years, an increasing proportion of the value of companies has\ncome from intangible assets like franchises, brand names, and patents\nand trademarks. Since these factors (along with goodwill from acqui-\nsitions) are excluded from the standard definition of book value, most\ncompanies today are priced at higher price-to-book multiples than in\nGraham’s day.

Our empha-\nsis in selection has been chiefly on exclusions—advising on the one\nhand against all issues of recognizably poor quality, and on the\nother against the highest-quality issues if their price is so high as to\ninvolve a considerable speculative risk.

These costs are not negligible in themselves; but\nwhen they are compared with the approximately 15% annual over-\nall return on common stocks generally in the decade 1951–1960,\nand even the 6% return in 1961–1970, they do not bulk large. A\nsmall amount of superior selective ability should easily have over-\ncome that expense handicap and brought in a superior net result\nfor the fund shareholders.\nTaken as a whole, however, the all-common-stock funds failed\nover a long span of years to earn quite as good a return as was\nshown on Standard & Poor’s 500-stock averages or the market as a\nwhole.

For a variety of rea-\nsons, most members of the public who put their money in common\nstocks of their own choice fail to do nearly as well. But to the objec-\ntive observer the failure of the funds to better the performance\nof a broad average is a pretty conclusive indication that such an\nachievement, instead of being easy, is in fact extremely difficult.\nWhy should this be so? We can think of two different explana-\ntions, each of which may be partially applicable. The first is the\npossibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current\nprices not only all the important facts about the companies’ past\nand current performance, but also whatever expectations can be\nreasonably formed as to their future. If this is so, then the diverse\nmarket movements which subsequently take place—and these are\noften extreme—must be the result of new developments and prob-\nabilities that could not be reliably foreseen. This would make the\nprice movements essentially fortuitous and random. To the extent\nthat the foregoing is true, the work of the security analyst—how-\never intelligent and thorough—must be largely ineffective, because\nin essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable.\nThe very multiplication of the number of security analysts may\nhave played an important part in bringing about this result. With\nhundreds, even thousands, of experts studying the value factors\nbehind an important common stock, it would be natural to expect\nthat its current price would reflect pretty well the consensus of\ninformed opinion on its value. Those who would prefer it to other\nissues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism\nthat could just as well be wrong as right.\nWe have often thought of the analogy between the work of the\nhost of security analysts on Wall Street and the performance of\nmaster bridge players at a duplicate-bridge tournament. The for-\nmer try to pick the stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get\ntop score for each hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish\neither aim. To the extent that all the bridge players have about the\nsame level of expertness, the winners are likely to be determined\nby “breaks” of various sorts rather than superior skill. On Wall\nStreet the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that\nexists in the profession, under which ideas and discoveries are\nquite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of various sorts.\nwww.fx1618.com",

Perhaps many\nof the security analysts are handicapped by a flaw in their basic\napproach to the problem of stock selection. They seek the indus-\ntries with the best prospects of growth, and the companies in these\nindustries with the best management and other advantages. The\nimplication is that they will buy into such industries and such com-\npanies at any price, however high, and they will avoid less promis-\ning industries and companies no matter how low the price of their\nshares.

It\nwould be rather strange if—with all the brains at work profession-\nally in the stock market—there could be approaches which are both\nsound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation\nhave been based on this unlikely fact.*\nASummary of the Graham-Newman Methods\nTo give concreteness to the last statement, it should be worth-\nwhile to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged\nin during the thirty-year life of Graham-Newman Corporation,\nbetween 1926 and 1956.† These were classified in our records as\nfollows:\nArbitrages:The purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale\n*In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is summarizing the\nEfficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the contrary, the prob-\nlem with the stock market today is not that so many financial analysts are\nidiots, but rather that so many of them are so smart. As more and more\nsmart people search the market for bargains, that very act of searching\nmakes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel paradox, makes the analysts look\nas if they lack the intelligence to justify the search. The market’s valuation of\na given stock is the result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of col-\nlective intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective intelli-\ngence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does Graham’s\n“Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of whack.\n†Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved\nit when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the suc-\ncessor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account, which\nhe ran frowmw Jawnu.afryx 1196261, 8th.rocuoghm December 1935.",

Our purchases were\nmade typically at two-thirds or less of such stripped-down asset\nvalue.

In consequence of these follow-ups we discontinued two\nbroader fields, which were found not to have shown satisfactory\noverall results. The first was the purchase of apparently attractive\nissues—based on our general analysis—which were not obtainable\nat less than their working-capital value alone. The second were\n“unrelated” hedging operations, in which the purchased security\nwas not exchangeable for the common shares sold.

The first such clue that comes to mind is a low price in\nrelation to recent earnings. Let’s make a preliminary list of stocks\nthat sold at a multiple of nine or less at the end of 1970. That datum\nis conveniently provided in the last column of the even-numbered\npages. For an illustrative sample we shall take the first 20 such low-\nmultiplier stocks; they begin with the sixth issue listed, Aberdeen\nMfg. Co., which closed the year at 101⁄, or 9 times its reported earn-\n4\nings of $1.25 per share for the 12 months ended September 1970.\nThe twentieth such issue is American Maize Products, which\nclosed at 91⁄, also with a multiplier of 9.\n2\nThe group may have seemed mediocre, with 10 issues selling\nbelow $10 per share. (This fact is not truly important; it would\nprobably—not necessarily—warn defensive investors against such\na list, but the inference for enterprising investors might be favor-\nable on balance.)* Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate\nsome numbers. Our list represents about one in ten of the first 200\nissues looked at. On that basis the Guide should yield, say, 450\nissues selling at multipliers under 10. This would make a goodly\nnumber of candidates for further selectivity.\nSo let us apply to our list some additional criteria, rather similar\nto those we suggested for the defensive investor, but not so severe.\nWe suggest the following:\n1. Financial condition: (a)Current assets at least 11⁄ times current\n2\nliabilities, and (b)debt not more than 110% of net current assets\n(for industrial companies).\n*For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around $1 per share—the\nlevel below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared ineligible for trad-\ning on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock prices of these companies\ncan take a considerable amount of effort, making them impractical for defen-\nsive investors. The costs of trading low-priced stocks can be very high.\nFinally, companies with very low stock prices have a distressing tendency to\ngo out of business.

We have already pointed out that\nthe low-multiplier criterion applied to the DJIAat the end of 1968\nworked out badly when the results are measured to mid-1971. The\nrecord of common-stock purchases made at a price below their\nworking-capital value has no such bad mark against it; the draw-\nback here has been the drying up of such opportunities during\nmost of the past decade.\nWhat about other bases of choice? In writing this book we have\nmade a series of “experiments,” each based on a single, fairly obvi-\nous criterion. The data used would be readily found in the Stan-\ndard & Poor’s Stock Guide. In all cases a 30-stock portfolio was\nassumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then\nrevalued at June 30, 1971. The separate criteria applied were the\nfollowing, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) Alow multi-\nplier of recent earnings (not confined to DJIA issues). (2) A high\ndividend return. (3) Avery long dividend record. (4) Avery large\nenterprise, as measured by number of outstanding shares. (5) A\nstrong financial position. (6) Alow price in dollars per share. (7) A\nlow price in relation to the previous high price. (8) Ahigh quality-\nranking by Standard & Poor’s.\nIt will be noted that the Stock Guidehas at least one column relat-\ning to each of the above criteria. This indicates the publisher’s\nbelief that each is of importance in analyzing and choosing com-\nmon stocks. (As we pointed out above, we should like to see\nanother figure added: the net-asset-value per share.)\nThe most important fact that emerges from our various tests\nrelates to the performance of stocks bought at random. We have\ntested this performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up\nof issues found on the first line of the December 31, 1968, Stock\nGuide and also found in the issue for August 31, 1971. Between\nthese two dates the S & P composite was practically unchanged,\nand the DJIA lost about 5%. But our 90 randomly chosen issues\ndeclined an average of 22%, not counting 19 issues that were\ndropped from the Guideand probably showed larger losses. These\ncomparative results undoubtedly reflect the tendency of smaller\nissues of inferior quality to be relatively overvalued in bull mar-\nkets, and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger\nissues in the ensuing price collapse, but also to delay their full\nrecovery—in many cases indefinitely.

These advanced 91⁄% in\n2\nthe period against a decline of 2.4% for the S & Pindustrials, and\n5.6% for the DJIA.

It is worth remarking that the S & Prankings showed\nup very well in this single test. In every case a portfolio based on a\nhigher ranking did better than a lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Com-\npanies with more than 50 million shares outstanding showed no\nchange on the whole, as against a small decline for the indexes. (3)\nStrangely enough, stocks selling at a high price per share (over 100)\nshowed a slight (1%) composite advance.\nAmong our various tests we made one based on book value, a\nfigure not given in the Stock Guide.Here we found—contrary to our\ninvestment philosophy—that companies that combined major size\nwith a large good-will component in their market price did very\nwell as a whole in the 21⁄-year holding period.

Even if the price may appear excessive by\nour quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may\nwell carry such issues along more or less indefinitely.

To quote the “old days” once more, the idea of good will\nas an element of intangible value was usually associated with a\n“trade name.” Names such as Lady Pepperell in sheets, Jantzen in\nswim suits, and Parker in pens would be considered assets of great\nvalue indeed. But now, if the “market doesn’t like a company,” not\nonly renowned trade names but land, buildings, machinery, and\nwhat you will, can all count for nothing in its scales.

In our previous\nedition we hazarded a single example (p. 188) which was current\nas we wrote. It was Burton-Dixie Corp., with stock selling at 20,\nagainst net-current-asset value of 30, and book value of about 50. A\nprofit on that purchase would not have been immediate. But in\nAugust 1967 all the shareholders were offered 533⁄ for their shares,\n4\nprobably at just about book value.

It\nwas commented upon above. Here we shall supply some examples\nof the genre, and some further remarks on what it appears to offer\nan open-minded and alert investor.\nThree such situations, among others, were current early in 1971,\nand they may be summarized as follows:\nSituation1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January\n1971 Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-\nRoth (“diversified apparel”) by giving 11⁄ shares of its own stock in\n3\nexchange for one share of Kayser-Roth. On the following day, in\nactive trading. Borden closed at 26 and Kayser-Roth at 28. If an\n“operator” had bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Bor-\nden at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the\nannounced terms, he would have had a profit of some 24% on the\ncost of his shares, less commissions and some other items. Assum-\ning the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might\nhave been at about a 40% per annum rate.\nSituation 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to\nbuy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at $11 in cash. The stock was sell-\ning at about 81⁄; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at\n2\nyear-end.

Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business\noperations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.\nThe treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of\nabout $281⁄ per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form.\n2\nThe stock closed 1970 at 211⁄, indicating a possible gross profit here, if\n2\nbook value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.\nIf operations of this kind, conducted on a diversified basis for\nspreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,\n20% or better, they would undoubtedly be more than merely\nworthwhile. Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are\nnot going into the details of the business—for it really is a business.\nLet us point out two contradictory developments there in recent\nyears. On the one hand the number of deals to choose from has\nincreased enormously, as compared with, say, ten years ago. This is\na consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to\ndiversify their activities through various types of acquisitions, etc.\nIn 1970 the number of “merger announcements” aggregated some\n5,000, down from over 6,000 in 1969. The total money values\ninvolved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhaps\nonly a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-\nsented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-\nsituations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep him\nbusy studying, picking, and choosing.\nThe other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of\nthe mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of\ncourse, the aimed-for profit is not realized, and is likely to be\nreplaced by a more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are\nnumerous, including antitrust intervention, shareholder opposi-\ntion, change in “market conditions,” unfavorable indications from\nfurther study, inability to agree on details, and others. The trick\nhere, of course, is to have the judgment, buttressed by experience,\nto pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are\nlikely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail.*\n*As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is wholly\ninappropriate for most individual investors.\nwww.fx1618.com",

In this chapter we’ll\nlook at several techniques that some of today’s leading money man-\nagers use for picking stocks.\nFirst, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors, selecting\nindividual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact that most\nprofessionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most\namateurs can do better. The vast majority of people who try to pick\nstocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the lucki-\nest ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take years to\nlearn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own\nstocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help, ideally through\nan index fund.\nGraham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest\nathletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per-\nformance.

Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-\nvent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to be\nstinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners andyour losers.\nAfter a year, measure your results against how you would have done if\nyou had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’t\nenjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selecting\nindividual stocks is not for you.

To see how much a company is truly earning\non the capital it deploys in its businesses, look beyond EPS to\nROIC, or return on invested capital. Christopher Davis of the\nDavis Funds defines it with this formula:\nROIC = Owner Earnings (cid:3)Invested Capital,\nwhere Owner Earnings is equal to:\nOperating profit\nplusdepreciation\nplusamortization of goodwill\nminusFederal income tax (paid at the company’s average rate)\nminuscost of stock options\nminus“maintenance” (or essential) capital expenditures\nminusany income generated by unsustainable rates of return on\npension funds (as of 2003, anything greater than 6.5%)\nand where Invested Capital is equal to:\nTotal assets\nminuscash (as well as short-term investments and non-interest-\nbearing current liabilities)\npluspast accounting charges that reduced invested capital.\nROIChas the virtue of showing, after all legitimate expenses,\nwhat the company earns from its operating businesses—and\nhow efficiently it has used the shareholders’ money to generate\nthat return.

Mason Hawkins get a better\nhandle on what a company’s parts are worth. For an individual\ninvestor, it’s painstaking and difficult work: Start by looking at the\n“Business Segments” footnote in the company’s annual report, which\ntypically lists the industrial sector, revenues, and earnings of each sub-\nsidiary. (The “Management Discussion and Analysis” may also be\nhelpful.) Then search a news database like Factiva, ProQuest, or\nLexisNexis for examples of other firms in the same industries that have\nrecently been acquired. Using the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov\nto locate their past annual reports, you may be able to determine the\nratio of purchase price to the earnings of those acquired companies.\nYou can then apply that ratio to estimate how much a corporate\nacquirer might pay for a similar division of the company you are inves-\ntigating.\nBy separately analyzing each of the company’s divisions this way,\nyou may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current\nstock price.

That helps provide the\nmargin of safety that Graham insists on.\nWHO’S THE BOSS?\nFinally, most leading professional investors want to see that a com-\npany is run by people who, in the words of Oakmark’s William Nygren,\n“think like owners, not just managers.” Two simple tests: Are the\ncompany’s financial statements easily understandable, or are they full\nof obfuscation?

Buffett likes to\nsnap up a stock when a scandal, big loss, or other bad news\npasses over it like a storm cloud—as when he bought Coca-Cola\nsoon after its disastrous rollout of “New Coke” and the market\ncrash of 1987.

Probably\nno other investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more\nabout his approach or written such compellingly readable\nessays.

As a parallel development, stock-option warrants—\nwhich are long-term rights to buy common shares at stipulated\nprices—have become more and more numerous. More than half\nthe preferred issues now quoted in the Standard & Poor’s Stock\nGuide have conversion privileges, and this has been true also of a\nmajor part of the corporate bondfinancing in 1968–1970. There are\nat least 60 different series of stock-option warrants dealt in on the\nAmerican Stock Exchange. In 1970, for the first time in its history,\nthe New York Stock Exchange listed an issue of long-term war-\nrants, giving rights to buy 31,400,000 American Tel. & Tel. shares at\n$52 each. With “Mother Bell” now leading that procession, it is\nbound to be augmented by many new fabricators of warrants.

The issuer is able to raise capital at a moderate\ninterest or preferred dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity\nmaterializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav-\ning it exchanged into common stock. Thus both sides to the bargain\nwill fare unusually well.\nObviously the foregoing paragraph must overstate the case\nsomewhere, for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar-\ngain much better for both sides. In exchange for the conversion\nprivilege the investor usually gives up something important in\nquality or yield, or both.1 Conversely, if the company gets its\nmoney at lower cost because of the conversion feature, it is surren-\ndering in return part of the common shareholders’ claim to future\nenhancement. On this subject there are a number of tricky argu-\nments to be advanced both pro and con.

That question will depend on all the facts\nsurrounding the individual issue.*\nWe do know, however, that the group of convertible issues\nfloated during the latter part of a bull market are bound to yield\nunsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,\nunfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done\nin the past.) The poor consequences must be inevitable, from the\ntiming itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invari-\nably make the conversion privilege much less attractive—and\noften, also, call into question the underlying safety of the issue\nitself.† As a group illustration we shall retain the example used in\n*Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric that investors\nusually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically offer “the best of both\nworlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand.

An\ninvestment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the\nbest of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.\n†According to Goldman Sachs and Ibbotson Associates, from 1998\nthrough 2002, convertibles generated an average annual return of 4.8%.\nThat was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks, but\nsubstantially worse than the returns of medium-term corporate bonds (a\nwww.fx1618.com",

Other things being equal, the opposite is\ntrue. But we clearly see that other things are not equal in practice\nand that the addition of the conversion privilege often—perhaps\ngenerally—betrays an absence of genuine investment quality for\nthe issue.\nIt is true, of course, that a convertible preferred is safer than the\ncommon stock of the same company—that is to say, it carries\nsmaller risk of eventual loss of principal. Consequently those who\nbuy new convertibles instead of the corresponding common stock\nare logical to that extent. But in most cases the common would not\nhave been an intelligent purchase to begin with, at the ruling price,\nand the substitution of the convertible preferred did not improve\nthe picture sufficiently. Furthermore, a good deal of the buying of\nconvertibles was done by investors who had no special interest or\nconfidence in the common stock—that is, they would never have\nthought of buying the common at the time—but who were\ntempted by what seemed an ideal combination of a prior claim\nplus a conversion privilege close to the current market. In a num-\nber of instances this combination has worked out well, but the sta-\ntistics seem to show that it is more likely to prove a pitfall.\nIn connection with the ownership of convertibles there is a spe-\ncial problem which most investors fail to realize. Even when a\nprofit appears it brings a dilemma with it. Should the holder sell on\na small rise; should he hold for a much bigger advance; if the issue\nis called—as often happens when the common has gone up consid-\nerably—should he sell out then or convert into and retain the com-\nmon stock?*\nLet us talk in concrete terms. You buy a 6% bond at 100, convert-\nible into stock at 25—that is, at the rate of 40 shares for each $1,000\nbond.

Aconservative person is likely to say that beyond 125\nhis position has become too speculative, and therefore he sells and\nmakes a gratifying 25% profit.\nSo far, so good. But pursue the matter a bit. In many cases where\nthe holder sells at 125 the common stock continues to advance, car-\nrying the convertible with it, and the investor experiences that\npeculiar pain that comes to the man who has sold out much too\nsoon. The next time, he decides to hold for 150 or 200. The issue\ngoes up to 140 and he does not sell. Then the market breaks and his\nbond slides down to 80. Again he has done the wrong thing.\nAside from the mental anguish involved in making these bad\nguesses—and they seem to be almost inevitable—there is a real\narithmetical drawback to operations in convertible issues. It may\nbe assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or\n30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings. This\nwould then mark the upper limit of profit and would be realized\nonly on the issues that worked out well. But, if—as appears to be\ntrue—these issues often lack adequate underlying security and\ntend to be floated and purchased in the latter stages of a bull mar-\nket, then a goodly proportion of them will fail to rise to 125 but will\nnot fail to collapse when the market turns downward. Thus the\nspectacular opportunities in convertibles prove to be illusory in\npractice, and the overall experience is marked by fully as many\nsubstantial losses—at least of a temporary kind—as there are gains\nof similar magnitude.\nBecause of the extraordinary length of the 1950–1968 bull market,\nconvertible issues as a whole gave a good account of themselves for\nsome 18 years. But this meant only that the great majority of common\nstocks enjoyed large advances, in which most convertible issues were\nable to share.

Like several of our references it\nis based on our own investment operations. We were members of a\n“select group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a\nprivate offering of convertible 41⁄% debentures of Eversharp Co. at\n2\npar, convertible into common stock at $40 per share. The stock\nadvanced rapidly to 651⁄, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the\n2\nequivalent of 88. The latter price made the convertible debentures\nworth no less than 220. During this period the two issues were\ncalled at a small premium; hence they were practically all converted\ninto common stock, which was retained by a number of the original\ninvestment-fund buyers of the debentures. The price promptly\nbegan a severe decline, and in March 1948 the stock sold as low as\n73⁄. This represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues, or a\n8\nloss of 75% of the original price instead of a profit of over 100%.\nThe real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers\nconverted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its\ngreat decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall\nStreet, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this\nadvice? Because once you convert you have lost your strategic com-\nbination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive\nprofit. You have probably turned from investor into speculator, and\nquite often at an unpropitious time (because the stock has already\nhad a large advance). If “Never convert a convertible” is a good\nrule, how came it that these experienced fund managers exchanged\ntheir Eversharp bonds for stock, to their subsequent embarrassing\nloss? The answer, no doubt, is that they let themselves be carried\naway by enthusiasm for the company’s prospects as well as by the\n“favorable market action” of the shares. Wall Street has a few pru-\ndent principles; the trouble is that they are always forgotten when\nthey are most needed.* Hence that other famous dictum of the old-\ntimers: “Do as I say, not as I do.”\nOur general attitude toward new convertible issues is thus a\nmistrustful one. We mean here, as in other similar observations,\n*This sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of the 1990s.\nAmong the “few prudent principles” that investors forgot were such market\nclichés as “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “Bulls make money, bears make\nmonewy, wbuwt p.igfsx g1e6t s1la8ug.hcteoremd.”",

The ideal combination, of course, is a\nstrongly secured convertible, exchangeable for a common stock\nwhich itself is attractive, and at a price only slightly higher than the\ncurrent market. Every now and then a new offering appears that\nmeets these requirements. By the nature of the securities markets,\nhowever, you are more likely to find such an opportunity in some\nolder issue which has developed into a favorable position rather\nthan in a new flotation. (If a new issue is a really strong one, it is\nnot likely to have a good conversion privilege.)\nThe fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in\na standard-type convertible issue is well illustrated by the exten-\nsive use of this type of security in the financing of American Tele-\nphone & Telegraph Company. Between 1913 and 1957 the company\nsold at least nine separate issues of convertible bonds, most of\nthem through subscription rights to shareholders. The convertible\nbonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in\na much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a\nstock offering, since the bonds were popular with many financial\ninstitutions which possess huge resources but some of which were\nnot permitted to buy stocks. The interest return on the bonds has\ngenerally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on\nthe stock—a factor that was calculated to offset the prior claim of\nthe bondholders. Since the company maintained its $9 dividend\nrate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split in 1959) the result was\nthe eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into\ncommon stock. Thus the buyers of these convertibles have fared\nwell through the years—but not quite so well as if they had bought\nthe capital stock in the first place. This example establishes the\nsoundness of American Telephone & Telegraph, but not the intrin-\nsic attractiveness of convertible bonds. To prove them sound in\npractice we should need to have a number of instances in which\nthe convertible worked out well even though the common stock\nproved disappointing.

Example: In\n1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these combina-\ntions of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and war-\nrants, for $20 per unit.\nLet us consider for a moment what is really involved in this\nfinancial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right\nto buy additional common shares when the company’s directors\nfind it desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “pre-\nemptive right” is one of the elements of value entering into the\nownership of common stock—along with the right to receive divi-\ndends, to participate in the company’s growth, and to vote for\ndirectors. When separate warrants are issued for the right to sub-\nscribe additional capital, that action takes away part of the value\ninherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate\ncertificate. An analogous thing could be done by issuing separate\ncertificates for the right to receive dividends (for a limited or\nunlimited period), or the right to share in the proceeds of sale or\nliquidation of the enterprise, or the right to vote the shares. Why\nthen are these subscription warrants created as part of the original\ncapital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial\nmatters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth less\nwith warrants outstanding than otherwise. Hence the package of\nstock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market\nthan would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports\nthe per-share earnings are (or have been) computed without\nproper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants. The result\nis, of course, to overstate the true relationship between the earnings\nand the market value of the company’s capitalization.*\n*Today, the last remnant of activity in warrants is in the cesspool of the\nNASDAQ “bulletin board,” or over-the-counter market for tiny companies,\nwhere common stock is often bundled with warrants into a “unit” (the con-\ntemporary equivalent of what Graham calls a “package”). If a stockbroker\never offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can be 95% certain that\nwarrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that the broker is either a\nthief or awn idwiowt.

Where large amounts of warrants have\nbeen issued in connection with the sale of senior securities, it is\ncustomary to make the adjustment by assuming that the proceeds\nof the stock payment are used to retire the related bonds or pre-\nferred shares.

The older warrants\nwere often perpetual, and they were likely to have fascinating price\nhistories over the years.\nExample: The record books will show that Tri-Continental Corp.\nwarrants, which date from 1929, sold at a negligible 1/32 of a dol-\nlar each in the depth of the depression. From that lowly estate their\nprice rose to a magnificent 753⁄ in 1969, an astronomical advance of\n4\nsome 242,000%. (The warrants then sold considerably higher than\nthe shares themselves; this is the kind of thing that occurs on Wall\nStreet through technical developments, such as stock splits.) A\nrecent example is supplied by Ling-Temco-Vought warrants, which\nin the first half of 1971 advanced from 21⁄ to 121⁄—and then fell\n2 2\nback to 4.\nNo doubt shrewd operations can be carried on in warrants from\ntime to time, but this is too technical a matter for discussion here.\nWe might say that warrants tend to sell relatively higher than the\ncorresponding market components related to the conversion privi-\nlege of bonds or preferred stocks. To that extent there is a valid\nargument for selling bonds with warrants attached rather than cre-\nating an equivalent dilution factor by a convertible issue. If the\nwarrant total is relatively small there is no point in taking its theo-\nretical aspect too seriously; if the warrant issue is large relative to\nthe outstanding stock, that would probably indicate that the com-\npany has a top-heavy senior capitalization. It should be selling\nadditional common stock instead. Thus the main objective of our\nattack on warrants as a financial mechanism is not to condemn\ntheir use in connection with moderate-size bond issues, but to\nargue against the wanton creation of huge “paper-money” mon-\nstrosities of this genre.\n*Graham, an enthusiastic reader of Spanish literature, is paraphrasing a line\nfrom the play Life Is a Dreamby Pedro Calderon de la Barca (1600–1681):\n“The greatest crime of man is having been born.”\nwww.fx1618.com",

Corinthians, XV:36.\nTHE ZEAL OF THE CONVERT\nAlthough convertible bonds are called “bonds,” they behave like\nstocks, work like options, and are cloaked in obscurity.\nIf you own a convertible, you also hold an option: You can either\nkeep the bond and continue to earn interest on it, or you can\nexchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predeter-\nmined ratio. (An option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another\nsecurity at a given price within a specific period of time.) Because they\nare exchangeable into stock, convertibles pay lower rates of interest\nthan most comparable bonds. On the other hand, if a company’s stock\nprice soars, a convertible bond exchangeable into that stock will per-\nform much better than a conventional bond. (Conversely, the typical\nconvertible—with its lower interest rate—will fare worse in a falling\nbond market.)1\n1As a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice, consider the\n4.75% convertible subordinated notes issued by DoubleClick Inc. in 1999.\nThey pay $47.50 in interest per year and are each convertible into 24.24\nshares of the company’s common stock, a “conversion ratio” of 24.24. As of\nyear-end 2002, DoubleClick’s stock was priced at $5.66 a share, giving\neach bond a “conversion value” of $137.20 ($5.66 (cid:1)24.24). Yet the bonds\ntraded roughly six times higher, at $881.30—creating a “conversion pre-\nmium,” or excess over their conversion value, of 542%. If you bought at that\nprice, your “break-even time,” or “payback period,” was very long. (You paid\nroughly $750 more than the conversion value of the bond, so it will take\nnearly 16w yewarws o.ff $x417.6501 i8nt.ecreostm payments for you to “earn back” that con-\n418",

      "text": "Commentary on Chapter 16 419\nFrom 1957 through 2002, according to Ibbotson Associates, con-\nvertible bonds earned an annual average return of 8.3%—only two per-\ncentage points below the total return on stocks, but with steadier\nprices and shallower losses.2 More income, less risk than stocks: No\nwonder Wall Street’s salespeople often describe convertibles as a\n“best of both worlds” investment. But the intelligent investor will\nquickly realize that convertibles offer less income and more risk than\nmost other bonds. So they could, by the same logic and with equal\njustice, be called a “worst of both worlds” investment. Which side you\ncome down on depends on how you use them.\nIn truth, convertibles act more like stocks than bonds. The return on\nconvertibles is about 83% correlated to the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock index—but only about 30% correlated to the performance of\nTreasury bonds. Thus, “converts” zig when most bonds zag. For con-\nservative investors with most or all of their assets in bonds, adding a\ndiversified bundle of converts is a sensible way to seek stock-like\nreturns without having to take the scary step of investing in stocks\ndirectly. You could call convertible bonds “stocks for chickens.”\nAs convertibles expert F. Barry Nelson of Advent Capital Manage-\nment points out, this roughly $200 billion market has blossomed since\nGraham’s day. Most converts are now medium-term, in the seven-to-\n10-year range; roughly half are investment-grade; and many issues\nnow carry some call protection (an assurance against early redemp-\ntion). All these factors make them less risky than they used to be.3\nversion premium.) Since each DoubleClick bond is convertible to just over\n24 common shares, the stock will have to rise from $5.66 to more than $36\nif conversion is to become a practical option before the bonds mature in\n2006. Such a stock return is not impossible, but it borders on the miracu-\nlous. The cash yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate, given\nthe low probability of conversion.\n2Like many of the track records commonly cited on Wall Street, this one is\nhypothetical. It indicates the return you would have earned in an imagin-\nary index fund that owned all major convertibles. It does not include any\nmanagement fees or trading costs (which are substantial for convertible\nsecurities). In the real world, your returns would have been roughly two per-\ncentage points lower.\n3However, most convertible bonds remain junior to other long-term debt\nand bwanwk wloa.nfsx—1so6, 1in 8a .bcaonkmruptcy, convertible holders do not have prior",

Fortunately, today’s intelligent investor has the con-\nvenient recourse of buying a low-cost convertible bond fund.

These intricate securities put a\n“floor” under your potential losses, but also cap your potential profits\nand often compel you to convert into common stock on a fixed date.\nLike most investments that purport to ensure against loss (see sidebar\non p. 421), these things are generally more trouble than they are\nworth.

(A recent Google search\non “covered call writing” turned up more than 2,600 hits.) What\nare covered calls, and how do they work? Imagine that you buy\n100 shares of Ixnay Corp. at $95 apiece. You then sell (or\n“write”) a call option on your shares. In exchange, you get a\ncash payment known as a “call premium.” (Let’s say it’s $10 per\nshare.) The buyer of the option, meanwhile, has the contractual\nright to buy your Ixnay shares at a mutually agreed-upon price—\nsay, $100. You get to keep the stock so long as it stays below\n$100, and you earn a fat $1,000 in premium income, which will\ncushion the fall if Ixnay’s stock crashes.\nLess risk, more income. What’s not to like?\nWell, now imagine that Ixnay’s stock price jumps overnight to\n$110. Then your option buyer will exercise his rights, yanking\nyour shares away for $100 apiece.

Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the financial world. It has\ndefaulted on most of its bond issues, and has been in danger of\nabandoning its operations entirely. Its security issues fell drasti-\ncally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 861⁄\n2\nas recently as 1968 to a low of 51⁄ in 1970. (There seems little doubt\n2\nthat these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.)*\nOur basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of\nsecurity analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment\nwould have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen-\ntral system long before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the\nshares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its\nbond issues could have been exchanged at even prices for well-\nsecured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates. The\nfollowing comments are in order:\n1. In the S & PBond Guidethe interest charges of the system are\nshown to have been earned 1.91 times in 1967 and 1.98 times in\n1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our\ntextbook Security Analysis is 5 times before income taxes and 2.9\ntimes after income taxes at regular rates. As far as we know the\nvalidity of these standards has never been questioned by any\ninvestment authority. On the basis of our requirements for earnings\nafter taxes,the Penn Central fell short of the requirements for safety.\nBut our after-tax requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five\ntimes, with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest. In\nthe case of Penn Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak\nof for the past 11 years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges\nbefore taxes was less than two times—a totally inadequate figure\nagainst our conservative requirement of 5 times.\n*How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s bankruptcy,\nwhich was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The closing trade\nin Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was $11.25 per share—hardly a\ngoing-out-of-business price.

The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a\nperiod should have raised serious questions about the validityof its\nreported earnings.\n3.

For example, in 1969, Pennsylvania RR\n41⁄s, due 1994 (part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 741⁄, while\n2 2\nPennsylvania Electric Co. 43⁄s, due 1994, had a range of 641⁄ to 721⁄.\n8 4 4\nThe public utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in\n1968 against only 1.98 times for the Penn Central system; during\n1969 the latter’s comparative showing grew steadily worse.

This is done in Table 17-1.\nThe first column shows the company’s modest beginnings in 1958,\nwhen its sales were only $7 million. The next gives figures for 1960;\nthe enterprise had grown twentyfold in only two years, but it was\nstill comparatively small. Then came the heyday years to 1967 and\n1968, in which sales again grew twentyfold to $2.8 billion with the\ndebt figure expanding from $44 million to an awesome $1,653 mil-\nlion. In 1969 came new acquisitions, a further huge increase in debt\n(to a total of $1,865 million!), and the beginning of serious trouble.\nAlarge loss, after extraordinary items, was reported for the year;\nthe stock price declined from its 1967 high of 1691⁄ to a low of 24;\n2\nthe young genius was superseded as the head of the company. The\n1970 results were even more dreadful. The enterprise reported a\nfinal net loss of close to $70 million; the stock fell away to a low\nprice of 71⁄, and its largest bond issue was quoted at one time at a\n8\npitiable 15 cents on the dollar.

His success at that led him to acquire\ndozens of different companies, almost always using LTV’s stock to pay for\nthem. The more companies LTV acquired, the higher its stock went; the\nhigher its stock went, the more companies it could afford to acquire. By\n1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune500 list of major U.S.\ncorporations. And then, as Graham shows, the whole house of cards came\ncrashing down. (LTV Corp., now exclusively a steelmaker, ended up seeking\nbankruptcy protection in late 2000.) Companies that grow primarily through\nacquisitions are called “serial acquirers”—and the similarity to the term\n“serial killers” is no accident. As the case of LTV demonstrates, serial acquir-\ners nearly always leave financial death and destruction in their wake.\nInvestors who understood this lesson of Graham’s would have avoided such\ndarlings of the 1990s as Conseco, Tyco, and WorldCom.\nwww.fx1618.com",

In addition, the long-term debt\namounted to $1,237 million. By 1969 combined debt reached a total\nof $1,869 million. This may have been the largest combined debt\nfigure of any industrial company anywhere and at any time, with\nthe single exception of the impregnable Standard Oil of N.J.\n5. The losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since\nthe formation of the company.\nMoral: The primary question raised in our mind by the Ling-\nTemco-Vought story is how the commercial bankers could have\nbeen persuaded to lend the company such huge amounts of money\nduring its expansion period. In 1966 and earlier the company’s\ncoverage of interest charges did not meet conservative standards,\nand the same was true of the ratio of current assets to current liabil-\nities and of stock equity to total debt. But in the next two years the\nbanks advanced the enterprise nearly $400 million additional for\nfurther “diversification.” This was not good business for them, and\nit was worse in its implications for the company’s shareholders.

Its business was described as “vulcanized fiber and plas-\ntics.” The management decided to take over the Sharon Steel Corp.,\n$1305.32 per share in March 2000, and finished 2002 at a princely $8.45\nper share.\n*Graham would have been disappointed, though surely not surprised, to\nsee that commercial banks have chronically kept supporting “unsound\nexpansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in corpo-\nrate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank loans.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The terms\nper share were $70 face amount of NVF junior 5% bonds, due 1994,\nplus warrants to buy 11⁄ shares of NVF stock at $22 per share of\n2\nNVF. The management of Sharon strenuously resisted this\ntakeover attempt, but in vain. NVF acquired 88% of the Sharon\nstock under the offer, issuing therefore $102 million of its 5% bonds\nand warrants for 2,197,000 of its shares. Had the offer been 100%\noperative the consolidated enterprise would, for the year 1968,\nhave had $163 million in debt, only $2.2 million in tangible stock\ncapital, $250 million of sales. The net-earnings question would\nhave been a bit complicated, but the company subsequently stated\nthem as a net loss of 50 cents per share of NVF stocks, before an\nextraordinary credit, and net earnings of 3 cents per share after\nsuch credit.*\nFirst Comment: Among all the takeovers effected in the year\n1969 this was no doubt the most extreme in its financial dispropor-\ntions.

The Commission alleged that Posner and his family had improperly\nobtained $1.7 million in personal perks from NVF and Sharon, overstated\nSharon’s pretax earnings by $13.9 million, misrecorded inventory, and\n“shifted income and expenses from one year to another.” Sharon Steel,\nwhich Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical eye, became\nknown among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner was later a\ncentral force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers that\nswept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a major customer for\nthe junk bwonwdsw u.nfdxe1rw6rit1te8n .bcy oDrmexel Burnham Lambert.",

This would\nhave indicated grave doubt of the safety of the bonds and of the\ncompany’s future; however, the management actually exploited\nthe bond price in a way to save the company annual income taxes\nof about $1,000,000 as will be shown.\nThe 1968 report, published after the Sharon takeover, contained\na condensed picture of its results, carried back to the year-end. This\ncontained two most unusual items:\n1. There is listed as an asset $58,600,000 of “deferred debt\nexpense.” This sum is greater than the entire “stockholders’\nequity,” placed at $40,200,000.\n2. However, not included in the shareholders’ equity is an item\nof $20,700,000 designated as “excess of equity over cost of invest-\nment in Sharon.”\nSecond Comment: If we eliminate the debt expense as an asset,\nwhich it hardly seems to be, and include the other item in the\nshareholders’ equity (where it would normally belong), then we\nhave a more realistic statement of tangible equity for NVF stock,\nviz., $2,200,000. Thus the first effect of the deal was to reduce\nNVF’s “real equity” from $17,400,000 to $2,200,000 or from $23.71\nper share to about $3 per share, on 731,000 shares. In addition the\nNVF shareholders had given to others the right to buy 31⁄ times as\n2\nmany additional shares at six points below the market price at the\nclose of 1968. The initial market value of the warrants was then\nabout $12 each, or a total of some $30 million for those involved in\nthe purchase offer. Actually, the market value of the warrants well\nexceeded the total market value of the outstanding NVF stock—\nanother evidence of the tail-wagging-dog nature of the transaction.\nThe Accounting Gimmicks\nWhen we pass from this pro forma balance sheet to the next\nyear’s report we find several strange-appearing entries.

None of them is even\nreferred to in the descriptive text of the 1969 report. The trained\nsecurity analyst has to figure out these mysteries by himself,\nalmost in detective fashion.

Right after the close of 1969 the company bought in no less\nthan 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. This was extraordi-\nnary when we consider that (a) NVF itself had only $700,000 in\ncash at the year-end, and had $4,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evi-\ndently the $6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed); (b)\nit was buying in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5%\nbonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar—ordinarily a\nwarning that financial difficulties lay ahead.\n2. As a partial offset to this, the company had retired $5,100,000\nof its bonds along with 253,000 warrants in exchange for a like\namount of common stock. This was possible because, by the\nvagaries of the securities markets, people were selling the 5%\nbonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of\n131⁄, paying no dividend.\n2\n3. The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock\nto its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of war-\nrantsto buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were\nto be paid for 5% down and the rest over many years in the future.\nThis is the only such employee-purchase plan for warrantsthat we\nknow of.

This consumed all its\ncapital before the financing, plus the entire $2,400,000 received on the\nsale of stock plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the\nfirst nine months of 1969.

Nonetheless the shares\nclosed the year 1969 at 81⁄ bid, or a “valuation” of more than $25 mil-\n8\nlion for the company.\nFurther Comment: 1. It is too much to believe that the company\nhad actually earned $686,000 from January to September 1969 and\nthen lost $4,365,000 in the next three months. There was something\nsadly, badly, and accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.\n2.

These latter quotations at least were\nbased on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and\ncommon sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation\nof $25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus-\ncule remnant of its capital, for which a completely insolvent condi-\ntion was imminent, and for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope”\nwould be only bitter sarcasms.

It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out\nof bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of\n$2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until\nin January 1971 AAA Enterprises finally filed a petition in bank-\nruptcy.

Included in those losses were $3.5 billion in\n“provisions for bad debts and customer financings,” $4.1 billion in\n“impairment charges related to goodwill,” and $362 million in charges\n“related to capitalized software.”\nLucent’s stock, at $51.062 on June 30, 2000, finished 2002 at\n$1.26—a loss of nearly $190 billion in market value in two-and-a-half\nyears.\nTHE ACQUISITION MAGICIAN\nTo describe Tyco International Ltd., we can only paraphrase Winston\nChurchill and say that never has so much been sold by so many to so\nfew. From 1997 through 2001, this Bermuda-based conglomerate spent\na total of more than $37 billion—most of it in shares of Tyco stock—buying\ncompanies the way Imelda Marcos bought shoes. In fiscal year 2000\nalone, according to its annual report, Tyco acquired “approximately 200\ncompanies”—an average of more than one every other day.\nThe result? Tyco grew phenomenally fast; in five years, revenues\nwent from $7.6 billion to $34 billion, and operating income shot from a\n$476 million loss to a $6.2 billion gain. No wonder the company had a\ntotal stock-market value of $114 billion at the end of 2001.\nBut Tyco’s financial statements were at least as mind-boggling as\nits growth. Nearly every year, they featured hundreds of millions of dol-\nlars in acquisition-related charges. These expenses fell into three main\ncategories:\n1) “merger” or “restructuring” or “other nonrecurring” costs,\n2) “charges for the impairment of long-lived assets,” and\n3) “write-offs of purchased in-process research and development.”\nFor the sake of brevity, let’s refer to the first kind of charge as\nMORON, the second as CHILLA, and the third as WOOPIPRAD. How\ndid they show up over time?\n2The demise of the Chromatis acquisition is discussed in The Financial Times,\nAugust 29, 2001, p. 1, and September 1/September 2, 2001, p. XXIII.\nwww.fx1618.com",

In 1999, after an accounting review by the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, Tyco retroactively added $257 million in\nMORON charges to its 1998 expenses—meaning that those “nonre-\ncurring” costs had actually recurred in that year, too.

Stock in Time\nWarner, a grab bag of cable television, movies, music, and magazines,\nsold for around 50 times earnings.\nIn announcing the deal, the two companies called it a “strategic\nmerger of equals.” Time Warner’s chairman, Gerald M.

But, in its 20 months in business,\neToys had produced total sales of $30.6 million, on which it had run a\nnet loss of $30.8 million—meaning that eToys was spending $2 to sell\nevery dollar’s worth of toys.\nThe IPO prospectus also disclosed that eToys would use some\nproceeds of the offering to acquire another online operation, Baby-\nCenter, Inc., which had lost $4.5 million on $4.8 million in sales over\nthe previous year. (To land this prize, eToys would pay a mere $205\nmillion.) And eToys would “reserve” 40.6 million shares of common\nstock for future issuance to its management.

For the two enterprises\ncombined, the 1969 price reflected almost $5 billion of good-will\nvaluation. How many years of excellent future earnings would it\ntake to “realize” that good-will factor in the form of dividends or\ntangible assets?\nSHORT-TERM SEQUEL: At the end of 1969 the market evidently\nthought more highly of the earnings prospects of Hospital than of\nHome, since it gave the former almost twice the multiplier of the\nlatter. As it happened the favored issue showed a microscopic\ndeclinein earnings in 1970, while Home turned in a respectable 8%\ngain.

But eight years later, on our comparison\ndate, its revenues had soared to $53.6 million and its net to $6.3\nmillion. At that time the stock market’s attitude toward this fine\nperformer appeared nothing less than ecstatic. The price of 55 at\nthe close of 1969 was more than 100 times the last reported 12-\nmonths’ earnings—which of course were the largest to date. The\naggregate market value of $300 million for the stock issue was\nnearly 30 times the tangible assets behind the shares.* This was\nalmost unheard of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations.\n(At that time IBM was selling at about 9 times and Xerox at 11\ntimes book value.)\nOur Table 18-4 sets forth in dollar figures and in ratios the\nextraordinary discrepancy in the comparative valuations of Block\nand Blue Bell. True, Block showed twice the profitability of Blue\nBell per dollar of capital, and its percentage growth in earnings\nover the past five years (from practically nothing) was much\nhigher.

Yet, mirabile dictu,\nIFF was actually selling at the end of 1969 for a higher aggregate\nmarket value than Harvester—$747 million versus $710 million.\nThis is the more amazing when one reflects that Harvester had 17\ntimes the stock capital of Flavors and 27 times the annual sales. In\n*Graham is alerting readers to a form of the “gambler’s fallacy,” in which\ninvestors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price purely because\nit is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more likely to turn up heads\nafter landing on tails for nine times in a row, so an overvalued stock (or stock\nmarket!) can stay overvalued for a surprisingly long time. That makes short-\nselling, or betting that stocks will drop, too risky for mere mortals.\n†International Harvester was the heir to McCormick Harvesting Machine\nCo., the manufacturer of the McCormick reaper that helped make the mid-\nwestern states the “breadbasket of the world.” But International Harvester\nfell on hard times in the 1970s and, in 1985, sold its farm-equipment busi-\nness to Tenneco.

In five years the net earnings of Flavors had\nnearly doubled, while those of Harvester practically stood still.\nBetween 1969 and 1959 the comparison makes similar reading.\nThese differences in performance produced a typical stock-market\ndivergence in valuation.

Let us call them “General” and “Presto.” We have\nselected the end of 1968 for our study, because the write-offs taken\nby General in 1969 made the figures for that year too ambiguous.\nThe full flavor of General’s far-flung activities could not be savored\nthe year before, but it was already conglomerate enough for\nanyone’s taste. The condensed description in the Stock Guide read\n“Nation-wide theatre chain; motion picture and TV production,\nsavings and loan assn., book publishing.” To which could be\nadded, then or later, “insurance, investment banking, records,\nmusic publishing, computerized services, real estate—and 35% of\nPerformance Systems Inc. (name recently changed from Minnie\nPearl’s Chicken System Inc.).” Presto had also followed a diversifi-\ncation program, but in comparison with General it was modest\nindeed. Starting as the leading maker of pressure cookers, it had\nbranched out into various other household and electric appliances.\nQuite differently, also, it took on a number of ordnance contracts\nfor the U.S. government.\n*In “the May 1970 debacle” that Graham refers to, the U.S. stock market\nlost 5.5%.

      "text": "464 The Intelligent Investor\nOur Table 18-7 summarizes the showing of the companies at the\nend of 1968. The capital structure of Presto was as simple as it\ncould be—nothing but 1,478,000 shares of common stock, selling in\nthe market for $58 million. Contrastingly, General had more than\ntwice as many shares of common, plus an issue of convertible pre-\nferred, plus three issues of stock warrants calling for a huge\namount of common, plus a towering convertible bond issue (just\ngiven in exchange for stock of an insurance company), plus a\ngoodly sum of nonconvertible bonds. All this added up to a market\ncapitalization of $534 million, not counting an impending issue of\nconvertible bonds, and $750 million, including such issue. Despite\nNational General’s enormously greater capitalization, it had actu-\nally done considerably less gross business than Presto in their fiscal\nyears, and it had shown only 75% of Presto’s net income.\nThe determination of the true market valueof General’s common-\nstock capitalization presents an interesting problem for security\nanalysts and has important implications for anyone interested in\nthe stock on any basis more serious than outright gambling. The\nrelatively small $41⁄ convertible preferred can be readily taken care\n2\nof by assuming its conversion into common, when the latter sells at\na suitable market level. This we have done in Table 18-7. But the\nwarrants require different treatment. In calculating the “full dilu-\ntion” basis the company assumes exercise of all the warrants, and\nthe application of the proceeds to the retirement of debt, plus use of\nthe balance to buy in common at the market. These assumptions\nactually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in\ncalendar 1968—which were reported as $1.51 both before and after\nallowance for dilution. We consider this treatment illogical and\nunrealistic. As we see it, the warrants represent a part of the “com-\nmon-stock package” and their market value is part of the “effective\nmarket value” of the common-stock part of the capital. (See our\ndiscussion of this point on p. 415 above.) This simple technique of\nadding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has\na radical effect on the showing of National General at the end of\n1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7. In fact the “true\nmarket price” of the common stock turns out to be more than twice\nthe quoted figure. Hence the true multiplier of the 1968 earnings is\nmore than doubled—to the inherently absurd figure of 69 times.\nThe total market value of the “common-stock equivalents” then\nwww.fx1618.com",

One is moved to ask how could Presto\npossibly be valued at only 6.9 times its current earnings when the\nmultiplier for General was nearly 10 times as great. All the ratios of\nPresto are quite satisfactory—the growth figure suspiciously so, in\nfact. By that we mean that the company was undoubtedly benefit-\ning considerably from its war work, and the shareholders should\nbe prepared for some falling off in profits under peacetime condi-\ntions. But, on balance, Presto met all the requirements of a sound\nand reasonably priced investment, while General had all the ear-\nmarks of a typical “conglomerate” of the late 1960s vintage, full of\ncorporate gadgets and grandiose gestures, but lacking in substan-\ntial values behind the market quotations.\nSEQUEL: General continued its diversification policy in 1969, with\nsome increase in its debt. But it took a whopping write-off of mil-\nlions, chiefly in the value of its investment in the Minnie Pearl\nChicken deal. The final figures showed a loss of $72 million before\ntax credit and $46.4 million after tax credit. The price of the shares\nfell to 161⁄ in 1969 and as low as 9 in 1970 (only 15% of its 1968 high\n2\nof 60). Earnings for 1970 were reported as $2.33 per share diluted,\nand the price recovered to 281⁄ in 1971. National Presto increased its\n2\nper-share earnings somewhat in both 1969 and 1970, marking 10\nyears of uninterrupted growth of profits. Nonetheless its price\ndeclined to 211⁄ in the 1970 debacle. This was an interesting figure,\n2\nsince it was less than four times the last reported earnings, and less\nthan the net current assets available for the stock at the time. Late in\n1971 we find the price of National Presto 60% higher, at 34, but the\nratios are still startling. The enlarged working capital is still about\nequal to the current price, which in turn is only 51⁄ times the last\n2\nreported earnings. If the investor could now find ten such issues, for\ndiversification, he could be confident of satisfactory results.*\n*National Presto remains a publicly-traded company.

First, in 2001,\ncame a $1.2 billion charge to “restructure” some of those acquisi-\ntions. Over the next two years, $1.3 billion in losses on those “invest-\nments” leaked out.

And in the past we have exceeded expecta-\ntions.”\nTwo things jump out from Hoffman’s answer:\n• Since Commerce One was already losing $2 on every dollar in\nsales, if it quadrupled its revenues (as “analysts expect”), wouldn’t\nit lose money even more massively?\n• How could Commerce One have exceeded expectations “in the\npast”?Whatpast?\nAsked whether his company would ever turn a profit, Hoffman was\nready: “There is no question we can turn this into a profitable busi-\nness.

The remaining 95% of\nPalm’s stock would be spun off to 3Com’s shareholders in the next\nfew months; for each share of 3Com they held, investors would\nreceive 1.525 shares of Palm.\nSo there were two ways you could get 100 shares of Palm: By try-\ning to elbow your way into the IPO, or by buying 66 shares of 3Com\nand waiting until the parent company distributed the rest of the Palm\nstock. Getting one-and-a-half shares of Palm for each 3Com share,\nyou’d end up with 100 shares of the new company—and you’d still\nhave 66 shares of 3Com.\nBut who wanted to wait a few months? While 3Com was struggling\nagainst giant rivals like Cisco, Palm was a leader in the hot “space” of\nhandheld digital organizers. So Palm’s stock shot up from its offering price\nof $38 to close at $95.06, a 150% first-day return. That valued Palm at\nmore than 1,350 times its earnings over the previous 12 months.\nThat same day, 3Com’s share price dropped from $104.13 to\n$81.81.

The company, an “Internet incubator,” financed and acquired\nstart-up firms in a variety of online businesses—among them such early\nstars as theglobe.com and Lycos.10\nIn fiscal year 1998, as its stock rose from 98 cents to $8.52,\nCMGIspent $53.8 million acquiring whole or partial stakes in Internet\ncompanies. In fiscal year 1999, as its stock shot from $8.52 to\n$46.09, CMGI shelled out $104.7 million. And in the last five months\nof 1999, as its shares zoomed up to $138.44, CMGI spent $4.1 bil-\nlion on acquisitions. Virtually all the “money” was CMGI’s own pri-\nvately-minted currency: its common stock, now valued at a total of\nmore than $40 billion.\nIt was a kind of magical money merry-go-round.

On July 16, Stryker announced that its sales grew 15% to\n$734 million in the second quarter, while earnings jumped 31% to\n$86 million. The stock rose 7% the next day, then rolled right back\ndownhill.\nBall, the original maker of the famous “Ball Jars” used for canning\nfruits and vegetables, now makes metal and plastic packaging for\nindustrial customers. Ball issued no press releases at all during those\ntwo weeks.

That brought its earn-\nings over the trailing four quarters to $152 million, so the stock was\ntrading at just 12.5 times Ball’s earnings. And, with a book value of\n$1.1 billion, you could buy the stock for 1.7 times what the company’s\ntangible assets were worth. (Ball did, however, have just over $900\nmillion in debt.)\nStryker was in a different league. Over the last four quarters, the\ncompany had generated $301 million in net income.

Nortel’s accounts receivable—\nsales to customers that had not yet paid the bill—had shot up by $1\nbillion in a year. The company said the rise “was driven by increased\nsales in the fourth quarter of 1999.” However, inventories had also bal-\nlooned by $1.2 billion—meaning that Nortel was producing equipment\neven faster than those “increased sales” could unload it.\nMeanwhile, Nortel’s “long-term receivables”—bills not yet paid for\nmulti-year contracts—jumped from $519 million to $1.4 billion. And Nor-\ntel was having a hard time controlling costs; its selling, general, and\nadministrative expense (or overhead) had risen from 17.6% of revenues\nin 1997 to 18.7% in 1999.

By December\n9, Red Hat’s shares hit $143.13—up 1,944% in four months.\nBrown Shoe, meanwhile, had its laces tied together. Founded in\n1878, the company wholesales Buster Brown shoes and runs nearly\n1,300 footwear stores in the United States and Canada. Brown Shoe’s\nstock, at $17.50 a share on August 11, stumbled down to $14.31 by\nDecember 9. For all of 1999, Brown Shoe’s shares lost 17.6%.12\n11All stock prices for Red Hat are adjusted for its two-for-one stock split in\nJanuary 2000.\n12Ironically, 65 years earlier Graham had singled out Brown Shoe as one of\nthe most stable companies on the New York Stock Exchange.

Innumerable such acquisi-\ntions have been accomplished by agreement with the existing man-\nagements, or else by accumulation of shares in the market and by\noffers made over the head of those in control. The price bid has\nusually been within the range of the value of the enterprise under\nreasonably competent management. Hence, in many cases, the\ninert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions of “out-\nsiders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups\nacting on their own.\nIt can be stated as a rule with very few exceptions that poor\nmanagements are not changed by action of the “public stockhold-\ners,” but only by the assertion of control by an individual or com-\npact group.

As a consequence, boards of\ndirectors have probably become more alive than previously to their\nfundamental duty to see that their company has a satisfactory top\nmanagement. Many more changes of presidents have been seen in\nrecent years than formerly.\nNot all companies in the unsatisfactory class have benefited\nfrom such developments. Also, the change has often occurred after\na long period of bad results without remedial action, and has\ndepended on enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low\nprices to permit the energetic outsiders to acquire a controlling\nposition in the shares.

In general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi-\ndends, while the managements preferred to keep the earnings in\nthe business “to strengthen the company.” They asked the share-\nholders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter-\nprise and for their own future long-term benefit. But in recent years\nthe attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a\ngradual but significant change. The basic argument now for paying\nsmall rather than liberal dividends is not that the company\n“needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to the shareholders’\ndirect and immediate advantage by retaining the funds for prof-\nitable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company that\nwas more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of paying\nout the usual 60% to 75% of them in dividends. The effect was\nalmost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays\nit is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber-\nately keeps down its dividend payments, with the approval of\ninvestors and speculators alike.*\nThere was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof-\n*The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s,\nwhen it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less likely it\nwas to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one.

But there were several\nstrong counter-arguments, such as: The profits “belong” to the\nshareholders, and they are entitled to have them paid out within\nthe limits of prudent management; many of the shareholders need\ntheir dividend income to live on; the earnings they receive in divi-\ndends are “real money,” while those retained in the company may\nor may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders.\nThese counter-arguments were so compelling, in fact, that the stock\nmarket showed a persistent bias in favor of the liberal dividend\npayers as against the companies that paid no dividends or rela-\ntively small ones.1\nIn the last 20 years the “profitable reinvestment” theory has\nbeen gaining ground. The better the past record of growth, the\nreadier investors and speculators have become to accept a low-\npay-out policy. So much is this true that in many cases of growth\nfavorites the dividend rate—or even the absence of any dividend—\nhas seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price.*\nAstriking example of this development is found in the history\nof Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock\nrose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing\nfrom 43 cents to $3.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind\nwas paid. (In 1962 cash dividends were initiated, but by that year\nthe earnings had fallen to $2.14 and the price had shown a spectac-\nular drop to a low of 49.)\nAnother extreme illustration is provided by Superior Oil. In\n1948 the company reported earnings of $35.26 per share, paid $3 in\ndividends, and sold as high as 235. In 1953 the dividend was\nreduced to $1, but the high price was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend\n*In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong advo-\ncates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back into the\nbusiness,” where they could earn higher returns than any outside share-\nholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him\nor her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never questioned the truth of this\npatronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or even realized that a company’s\ncash belongs to the shareholders, not its managers.

The conflicting views are\nwell illustrated by the cases of two of our very largest corpora-\ntions—American Telephone & Telegraph and International Busi-\nness Machines. American Tel. & Tel. came to be regarded as an\nissue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in\n1961 it sold at 25 times that year’s earnings. Nevertheless, the\ncompany’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and\nspeculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making\nan active response to even rumorsof an impending increase in the\ndividend rate. On the other hand, comparatively little attention\nappears to have been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in\n1960 yielded only 0.5% at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the\nclose of 1970. (But in both cases stock splits have operated as a\npotent stock-market influence.)\nThe market’s appraisal of cash-dividend policy appears to be\ndeveloping in the following direction: Where prime emphasis is\nnot placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and\nthe dividend rate retains its long-held importance as the prime\ndeterminant of market price. At the other extreme, stocks clearly\nrecognized to be in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily\nin terms of the expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and\nthe cash-dividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.\nWhile the above statement may properly describe present ten-\ndencies, it is by no means a clear-cut guide to the situation in all\ncommon stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one\nthing, many companies occupy an intermediate position between\ngrowth and nongrowth enterprises.

The most plausible explanation for this\ndecline is that corporate managers became uncomfortable with the idea\nthat shareholders might interpret special dividends as a signal that future\nprofits might be low.\n†The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and Franco\nModigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valua-\ntion of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in Economics. Miller\nand Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were irrelevant, since an\ninvestor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and a\nrising stock price, or through a rising stock price alone, so long as the total\nreturn is the same in either case.\nwww.fx1618.com",

The energy giant’s revenues,\nassets, and earnings were all rising like rockets.\nBut what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering\nnumbers—and had simply put Enron’s 1999 proxy statement\nunder the microscope of common sense? Under the heading\n“Certain Transactions,” the proxy disclosed that Enron’s chief\nfinancial officer, Andrew Fastow, was the “managing member”\nof two partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, that bought “energy and\ncommunications related investments.” And where was LJM1\nand LJM2 buying from? Why, where else but from Enron! The\nproxy reported that the partnerships had already bought $170\nmillion of assets from Enron—sometimes using money borrowed\nfrom Enron.\nThe intelligent investor would immediately have asked:\n• Did Enron’s directors approve this arrangement? (Yes, said\nthe proxy.)\n• Would Fastow get a piece of LJM’s profits? (Yes, said the\nproxy.)\n• As Enron’s chief financial officer, was Fastow obligated to act\nexclusively in the interests of Enron’s shareholders? (Of\ncourse.)\n• Was Fastow therefore duty-bound to maximize the price\nEnron obtained for any assets it sold? (Absolutely.)\n• But if LJM paid a high price for Enron’s assets, would that\nlower LJM’s potential profits—and Fastow’s personal\nincome? (Clearly.)\n• On the other hand, if LJM paid a low price, would that raise\nprofits for Fastow and his partnerships, but hurt Enron’s\nincome? (Clearly.)\n• Should Enron lend Fastow’s partnerships any money to buy\nassets from Enron that might generate a personal profit for\nFastow? (Say what?!)\n• Doesn’t all this constitute profoundly disturbing conflicts of\ninterest? (No other answer is even possible.)\nwww.fx1618.com",

In its proxy statement, which it sends to every shareholder, a com-\npany announces the agenda for its annual meeting and discloses\ndetails about the compensation and stock ownership of managers\nand directors, along with transactions between insiders and the com-\npany. Shareholders are asked to vote on which accounting firm should\naudit the books and who should serve on the board of directors.

Graham saw right through this managerial\nmalarkey:\nA company’s management may run the business well and yet not give\nthe outside stockholders the right results for them, because its effi-\nciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use\nof the capital. The objective of efficient operationis to produce at low\ncost and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance\nrequires that the stockholders’ money be working in forms most suit-\nable to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such,\nhas little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital from\nthe owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own financial\nproblems. Thus the typical management will operate with more capital\nthan necessary, if the stockholders permit it—which they often do.8\nIn the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the managements of\nleading technology companies took this “Daddy-Knows-Best” attitude\nto new extremes. The argument went like this: Why should you\ndemand a dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn it\ninto a rising share price? Just look at the way our stock has been\ngoing up—doesn’t that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollars\nbetter than you can?\nIncredibly, investors fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Daddy Knows\nBest became such gospel that, by 1999, only 3.7% of the companies\nthat first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividend—down\nfrom an average of 72.1% of all IPOs in the 1960s.9Just look at how\n81949 edition, p. 233.\n9Eugene F.

After the stock market crash of October 19,\n1987, for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next\n12 days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in\nthe earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher.

That conversion of options to shares is called “exercising”\nthe options. The employees can then sell the shares at the current market\nprice and pocket the difference as profit. Because hundreds of millions of\noptions may be exercised in a given year, the company must increase its\nsupply of shares outstanding. Then, however, the company’s total net\nincome would be spread across a much greater number of shares, reducing\nits earnings per share. Therefore, the company typically feels compelled to\nbuy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders.\nIn 1998, 63.5% of chief financial officers admitted that counteracting the\ndilution from options was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFO\nForum, “The Buyback Track,” Institutional Investor,July, 1998).\nwww.fx1618.com",

In 1997, Steve\nJobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the company\nas its “interim” chief executive officer. Already a wealthy man, Jobs\ninsisted on taking a cash salary of $1 per year. At year-end 1999, to\nthank Jobs for serving as CEO “for the previous 21/2 years without\ncompensation,” the board presented him with his very own Gulfstream\njet, at a cost to the company of a mere $90 million. The next month\nJobs agreed to drop “interim” from his job title, and the board\nrewarded him with options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs had\nheld a grand total of two shares of Apple stock.)\nThe principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of\nmanagers with outside investors. If you are an outside Apple share-\nholder, you want its managers to be rewarded only if Apple’s stock\nearns superior returns. Nothing else could possibly be fair to you and\nthe other owners of the company. But, as John Bogle, former chairman\nof the Vanguard funds, points out, nearly all managers sell the stock\nthey receive immediately after exercising their options. How could\ndumping millions of shares for an instant profit possibly align their\ninterests with those of the company’s loyal long-term shareholders?\nIn Jobs’ case, if Apple stock rises by just 5% annually through the\nbeginning of 2010, he will be able to cash in his options for $548.3\nmillion. In other words, even if Apple’s stock earns no better than half\nthe long-term average return of the overall stock market, Jobs will land\na half-a-billion dollar windfall.22Does that align his interests with those\nof Apple’s shareholders—or malign the trust that Apple’s shareholders\nhave placed in the board of directors?\nReading proxy statements vigilantly, the intelligent owner will vote\nagainst any executive compensation plan that uses option grants to\nturn more than 3% of the company’s shares outstanding over to the\nmanagers.

The amount\nof this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-\nmated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues\nover a period of years.

Yes, but with some necessary modifications.\nThere are instances where a common stock may be considered\nsound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good\nbond.

On this basis, the excess of stock earning power over\nbond interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to con-\nstitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason we feel that\nthere are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound common\nstocks.

Thus it follows that most of\nthe fair-weather investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are\ndestined to suffer disturbing price declines when the horizon\nclouds over—and often sooner than that. Nor can the investor\ncount with confidence on an eventual recovery—although this\ndoes come about in some proportion of the cases—for he has never\nhad a real safety margin to tide him through adversity.\nThe philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part\nand in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. The\ngrowth-stock buyer relies on an expected earning power that is\ngreater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to\nsubstitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating\nhis margin of safety. In investment theory there is no reason why\ncarefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guide\nthan the bare record of the past; in fact, security analysis is coming\nmore and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of the\nfuture. Thus the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable\na margin of safety as is found in the ordinary investment—\nprovided the calculation of the future is conservatively made, and\nprovided it shows a satisfactory margin in relation to the price\npaid.\nThe danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For\nsuch favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that\nwill not be adequately protected by a conservative projection of\nfuture earnings. (It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all\nestimates, when they differ from past performance, must err at\nleast slightly on the side of understatement.) The margin of safety\nis always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price,\nsmall at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price. If,\nas we suggest, the average market level of most growth stocks is\ntoo high to provide an adequate margin of safety for the buyer,\nthen a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not\nwork out satisfactorily. Aspecial degree of foresight and judgment\nwill be needed, in order that wise individual selections may over-\ncome the hazards inherent in the customary market level of such\nissues as a whole.\nThe margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when\nwe apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities.

It is available for absorbing the\neffect of miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of\nbargain issues places particular emphasis on the ability of the\ninvestment to withstand adverse developments. For in most such\ncases he has no real enthusiasm about the company’s prospects.\nTrue, if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to\navoid the security no matter how low the price. But the field of\nundervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns—perhaps a\nmajority of the total—for which the future appears neither dis-\ntinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are bought\non a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power\nneed not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results.\nThe margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.\nTheory of Diversification\nThere is a close logical connection between the concept of a\nsafety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correla-\ntive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an\nindividual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees\nonly that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that\nloss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is\nincreased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the\nprofits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple\nbasis of the insurance-underwriting business.\nDiversification is an established tenet of conservative invest-\nment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-\nstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which\ndiversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-\norful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 on\na single number, he is paid $35 profit when he wins—but the\nchances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin of\nsafety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he\nbets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-\nlarly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain to\nlose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received\n$39 profit instead of $35. Then he would have a small but impor-\ntant margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,\nwww.fx1618.com",

Many of them deny that there is any useful or depend-\nable difference between the concepts of investment and of specula-\ntion. We think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It is\ninjurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of\nmany people toward the excitement and hazards of stock-market\nspeculation. We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be\nused to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment\noperation from a speculative one.\nProbably most speculators believe they have the odds in their\nfavor when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay\nclaim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-\ning that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is\nsuperior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-\nthy. But such claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjective\njudgment, unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any\n*In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers\n1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a maximum payout\nof 35 to 1. What if you bet $1 on every number? Since only one slot can\nbe the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, but\nlose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-\nence (or a 5.26% spread on your total $38 bet) is the casino’s “house\nadvantage,” ensuring that, on average,roulette players will always lose more\nthan they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as\npossible, it is in the casino’s interest to keep the roulette wheel spinning.\nLikewise, the intelligent investor should seek to maximize the number of\nholdings that offer “a better chance for profit than for loss.” For most\ninvestors, diversification is the simplest and cheapest way to widen your\nmargin of safety.\nwww.fx1618.com",

We greatly doubt whether the man\nwho stakes money on his view that the market is heading up or\ndown can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any\nuseful sense of the phrase.\nBy contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as\ndeveloped earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definite\narithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it\nis well supported by practical investment experience. There is no\nguarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will con-\ntinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions of\nthe future.

The broadest\ncategory is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com-\npanies, which we recommend for purchase when they can be\nbought at two-thirds or less of their indicated value. Besides these,\nthere is often a wide choice of medium-grade corporate bonds and\npreferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as\nto be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent\nvalue.

For, if the price is low enough to\ncreate a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our\ncriterion of investment. Our favorite supporting illustration is\ntaken from the field of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions of\ndollars’ worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom-\nmended as sound investments. A large proportion had so little\nmargin of value over debt as to be in fact highly speculative in\ncharacter. In the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of\nthese bonds defaulted their interest, and their price collapsed—in\nsome cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that stage the same\nadvisers who had recommended them at par as safe investments\nwere rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac-\ntive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90%\nmade many of these securities exceedingly attractive and reason-\nably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times\nthe market quotation.*\nThe fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in\nwhat is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent\nthem from having true investment qualities at their low prices.

Again there are risk factors in\neach individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations\nand absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.\nTo carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest\nthat a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying\nsuch intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-\nstock option warrants” selling at historically low prices.

A sufficiently enterprising\ninvestor could then include an option-warrant operation in his\nmiscellany of unconventional investments.1\nTo Sum Up\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is\namazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in\nWall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles\nthrough which they have gained success in their own undertak-\nings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first\ninstance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specific\nbusiness enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits from\nsecurity purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business ven-\nture of his own, which must be run in accordance with accepted\nbusiness principles if it is to have a chance of success.\nThe first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what\nyou are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:\nDo not try to make “business profits” out of securities—that is,\nreturns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless\nyou know as much about security values as you would need to\nknow about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-\nfacture or deal in.\nA second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your\nbusiness, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with ade-\nquate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-\nsons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For\nthe investor this rule should determine the conditions under which\nhe will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.\nAthird business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—\nthat is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-\nculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.\nIn particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to\ngain and much to lose.” For the enterprising investor this means\nthat his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but\non arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits his\nreturn to a small figure—as formerly, at least, in a conventional\nbond or preferred stock—he must demand convincing evidence\nthat he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.\nwww.fx1618.com",

If you overestimate\nhow well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability\nto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you\nown or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in\nwhat kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you\nare.

The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct\nin this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in the\nafterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” the\nprobability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and\nonly faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the proba-\nbilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per-\nfectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:\nSuppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and\nabstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed up\nsome goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose\nyou act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and\nlust when in fact God is.

But then, when you discover that Graham had painstakingly\nestablished that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paid\nfor it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.\nBut he needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk of\nsuch a big bet on so unknown a stock.1\nAnd today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:\nthe death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corpo-\nrate fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. “Investors don’t like\nuncertainty,” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV or\nin today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and\nyet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing\nworld. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart, “uncertainty”\nand “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one has ever been\ngiven the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buy\nstocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at\nall. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.\nThe most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,\ntold through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late in\nhis life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses\ndescribes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters\nbeyond the gates of Hercules:\n1Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who are\nnot as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against the risk of\nputting too much money into a single investment.

They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock\nprices reflect everything that is known about a company’s\nprospects and about the state of the economy. There are no under-\nvalued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart secu-\nrity analysts who utilize all available information to ensure\nunfailingly appropriate prices.

Crucial to this examination is the fact that\nthese winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as\nsuperior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fif-\nteen years ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recently\nsearched among thousands of records to select a few names for you\nthis morning—I would advise you to stop reading right here. I\nshould add that all these records have been audited. And I should\nfurther add that I have known many of those who have invested\nwith these managers, and the checks received by those participants\nover the years have matched the stated records.\nBefore we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a\nnational coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million\nAmericans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a\ndollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the\nflip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who\ncalled wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent\nday the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.\nAfter ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately\n220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten\nflips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\nNow this group will probably start getting a little puffed up\nabout this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-\nest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive\nmembers of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what\nmarvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\nAssuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards\nfrom the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who\nhave successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,\nby this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over\n$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would\nhave been won.\nBy then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-\nbly write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million in\nTwenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet,\nthey’ll probably start jetting around the country attending semi-\nnars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors\nwith, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\nBut then some business school professor will probably be\nrude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans\nwww.fx1618.com",

For one thing, if (a)\nyou had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the\nU.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if\n(c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you\nwould be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would\nprobably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding\nthem, whether they had special exercises, what books they read,\nand who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-\ndinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you\ncould identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might\nbe causal factors.\nScientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were\ntrying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with,\nsay, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400\nof them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you\nwould get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of\nthose afflicted, or other variables. You know that it’s not random\nchance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily\nknow the causal factors, but you would know where to search.\nI submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other\nthan geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be\nwhat I call an intellectualorigin. I think you will find that a dispro-\nportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment\nworld came from a very small intellectual village that could be\ncalled Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that\nsimply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-\nlar intellectual village.\nConditions could exist that would make even that concentration\nunimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-\nflipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he\ncalled heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same\nway. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that\n100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing.\nYou would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases.

Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so\nstrong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day,\nevery member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now,\nat the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and\nyou would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive\ntypes might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor\nas an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it\nwould have no significance at all because it would simply mean\nthat you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 ran-\ndomly distributed families who were winners.\nIn this group of successful investors that I want to consider,\nthere has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But\nthe children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have\ncalled their “flips” in very different ways. They have gone to differ-\nent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet\nthey have had a combined record that simply can’t be explained by\nrandom chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that\nthey are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the\ncalls to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual\ntheory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has\ndecided on his own manner of applying the theory.\nThe common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-\nand-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the\nvalueof a business and the priceof small pieces of that business in\nthe market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without\nthe efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are\nbought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,\netc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just\nwhat our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the\nmedium of marketable stocks—I doubt that many are cranking\ninto their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in\nwhich the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any dif-\nference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a\nFriday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and\neffort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small\npieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors,\nneedless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model,\nor covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of\nwww.fx1618.com",

The investors simply focus on two variables:\nprice and value.\nI always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of\nprice and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine\nbuying an entire business simply because the price of the business\nhad been marked up substantially last week and the week before?\nOf course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and\nvolume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are\nalmost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarily\nbecause such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are\nthere and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati-\ncal skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are\nacquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no\nutility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer,\neverything looks like a nail.\nI think the group that we have identified by a common intellec-\ntual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic\nstudies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, season-\nality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest\nhas been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con-\ncentration of value-oriented winners.\nI begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of\nus who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954\nthrough 1956. There were only four—I have not selected these\nnames from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-\nNewman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned\nme down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously!\nAfter much pestering he finally hired me. There were three part-\nners and four of us at the “peasant” level. All four left between\n1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to\ntrace the record of three.\nThe first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter\nSchloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben\nGraham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left\nGraham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here\nover 28 years.\nHere is what “Adam Smith”—after I told him about Walter—\nwrote about him in Supermoney(1972):\nwww.fx1618.com",

He knows how to identify securities that sell at consider-\nably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does.\nHe doesn’t worry about whether it’s January, he doesn’t worry\nabout whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an\nelection year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I\ncan buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he\ndoes it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks\nthan I do—and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the\nbusiness: I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter.\nThat’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.\nThe second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-\nNewman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before\nthe war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum.\nAnd then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night\ncourse in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit\nbasis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that\ncourse that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School,\nwhere he got the MBAdegree. He took Dodd’s course again, and\ntook Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom\nto ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the\nbeach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!\nIn 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple,\nalong with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed\nTweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in\nTable 2.

There is no single index\nI can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment\nmanagement at Berkshire.

Then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa-\ntion so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met\nin early 1951.

When I wound up\nBuffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle\nall our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a ter-\nrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier\nmarket and all the difficulties that made for comparative perfor-\nmance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my\npartners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but\nadded money, with the happy result shown.\nThere’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I\nrecommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he\nachieved a four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard &\nPoor’s, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well\nover that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That\nmakes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of perfor-\nmance. There is no question about it.

He was willing to accept greater peaks and\nvalleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose\nwhole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown.\nIncidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner\nfor a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he\nran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost\ncompletely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned\nearlier.\nTable 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie\nMunger’s—another non–business school type—who was a math\nmajor at USC.

Last year they had eight equity managers of any\nduration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record\nbetter than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the\nS&P. The net difference now between a median performance and\nthe actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243\nmillion. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the\nselection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I\nwould necessarily select but they have the common denominator\nof selecting securities based on value.\nSo these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-\nDoddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among\nthousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of\nlottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won the\nlottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework\nfor investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught\nand additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect,\ncharacter, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that\nthis group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record\nin years when the general market was weak. While they differ\ngreatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the\nbusiness, not buying the stock.Afew of them sometimes buy whole\nbusinesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of busi-\nnesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-\nness, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of\nstocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the differ-\nence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.\nI’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market.\nThese Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully ex-\nploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock\ncan be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the\nmargin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or\nthe most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market\nalways prices rationally.

If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline—\nperhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer\nme $5 million to pull the trigger twice—now that would be a posi-\ntive correlation between risk and reward!\nThe exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dol-\nlar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for\n40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case.\nThe greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less\nrisk there is.\nOne quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was\nselling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you\ncould have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than\n$400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the\nPost, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets.\nThose same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who\nwould have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.\nNow, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made\nthe valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would\nhave been greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the\ncheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in\nWonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to\nbuy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 mil-\nlion. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities\nand you know anything at all about business valuation, there is\nessentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particu-\nlarly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles for $8 million each.\nSince you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to\nbe sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people,\nbut that’s not a difficult job.\nYou also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a\nvery general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.\nBut you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by\nhaving a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth\n$83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-\ngin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000\npounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it.

Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment\nIncome and Security Transactions (in 1972)\nEditor’s note: Due to extensive changes in the rules governing such\ntransactions, the following document is presented here for historical\npurposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the\ninformation therein was correct. However, intervening developments\nhave rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-\ning Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of\n“The Basics of Investment Taxation,” which brings the reader up-to-\ndate on the relevant rules.\nRule 1—Interest and Dividends\nInterest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)\nincome received from state, municipal, and similar obligations,\nwhich are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)\ndividends representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends\npaid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of\nordinary domestic-corporation dividends.\nRule 2—Capital Gains and Losses\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses\nare merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the\nnet short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,\n100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-\nmum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on the\nbalance.\nA net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is\ndeductible from ordinary income to a maximum of $1,000 in the\ncurrent year and in each of the next five years. Alternatively,\nunused losses may be applied at any time to offset capital gains.\n(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally\nthan later losses.)\nNote Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”\nMost investment funds (“investment companies”) take advan-\ntage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be\nwww.fx1618.com",

Thus if they make long-term\nsecurity profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain divi-\ndends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way\nas long-term gains. These carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi-\ndends. Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% tax\nfor the account of its shareholders and then retain the balance of\nthe capital gains without distributing them as capital-gain divi-\ndends.\n3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)\nInterest and Dividends\nInterest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate\nexcept (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from\nFederal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-\nresenting a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain distribu-\ntions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity municipal\nbonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-\nnative minimum tax.\nCapital Gains and Losses\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are\nmerged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net\nshort-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, that\nexcess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-\ntal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—\nwhich will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,\n2000, and held for more than five years.\nA net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-\num of $3,000 in the current year.

The New Speculation in Common Stocks1\nWhat I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years\nin Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has\nincluded the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmo-\nsphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that\none of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-\nrity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-\nity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we\nhave no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least\nstudied and understood them. My address today is an effort\ntoward such understanding in a limited field—in particular, an\nendeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the\npresent and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-\nment and speculation in common stocks.\nLet me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-\nlative elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively in\nthe company itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating\nelements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-\ntion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of\ncourse; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished\nby a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But\nin revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-\nduced into the common-stock arena from outsidethe companies. It\ncomes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying public\nand their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude may\nbe described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-\ntions.\nNothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience\nthan the idea that a common stock should be valued and priced\nwww.fx1618.com",

For one thing, it obliterates a good part of\nthe older, well-established distinctions between investment and\nspeculation. The dictionary says that “speculate” comes from the\nLatin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked\nout and saw future developments coming before other people did.\nBut today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must\nhave his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common\nlookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.\nSecondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the\nbest investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the\nones which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest in\ntheir common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed\na brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-\nticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the application\nof formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present\nvalue of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-\nlas with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, or\nrather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high,\nfor a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on\nclose examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-\nsonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and\nmaintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the\nmarket may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-\ninglylowfigure.\nReturning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-\nulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them by\ntwo outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-\nnous. Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common\nstock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some data\nrelating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.\n(These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, Security\nAnalysis,McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)\nIn those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only\nbetween 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-\nings for the period.

Thus American Can common was a representative\nspeculative issue, because American Can Company was then a\nspeculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain\nindustry. Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-\nterm future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact\nnot suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if\nit had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors\nas basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the\nyears 1911–1913.\nNow, to expose you to the development through time of the\nimportance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to\nuse as my example our most spectacular giant industrial enter-\nprise—none other than International Business Machines, which\nlast year entered the small group of companies with $1 billion of\nsales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in\norder to inject a little of the personal touch into what otherwise\nwould be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college\nfor a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-\npany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-\nlutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose\nwe used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the then\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card\npunches, card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to\nbusinessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-\nsus Bureau. I entered Wall Street in 1914, and the next year the\nbonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-\nest in that enterprise, and besides I considered myself a sort of\ntechnological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-\ncial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went to\nthe head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him\nthat C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000\nshares); that it had earned $6.50 in 1915; that its book value—\nwww.fx1618.com",

[His favorite\nexpression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they\nare no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knows\nthere is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that\nwas the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account\nof the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial companies—\nnotably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but\nwater, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had\n“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects,\nno self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)\nI returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young\nman. Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, but\nextremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-\ning condemnation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I\nnever bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name was\nchanged to International Business Machines in 1926.\nNow let us take a look at the same company with its new name\nin 1926, a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it first\nrevealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large\nsum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar\nof the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-\ning but water. However, since that time the company had made an\nimpressive record under the direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its net\nhad risen from $691,000 to $3.7 million—over fivefold—a greater\npercentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year\nperiod. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and\nhad split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for the\nnew stock, while earnings were $6.39 thereon. You might have\nexpected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty enthusiastic\nabout a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade\nposition. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59\nhigh. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-\nplier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had\ndone in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible\nbook value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced\nthan elewvewn ywea.frxs 1ea6rl1ie8r..com",

What has happened since then can be\nsummarized by using ten-year intervals in the history of IBM. In\n1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-\nplier rose from 7 to 171⁄. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 21⁄ times,\n2 2\nbut the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 171⁄ 2.Then the pace\naccelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and the\naverage multiplier rose to 321⁄. Last year, with a further gain in net,\n2\nthe multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the\nunconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.\nWhen we examine these recent price figures with care we see\nsome interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years\nearlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance\nsheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by\ndisclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has\nbeen put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investors\nand speculators themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times its\nbook value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the\nsame as if it had no book value at all. Or the small book-value por-\ntion can be considered as a sort of minor preferred-stock compo-\nnent of the price, the rest representing exactly the same sort of\ncommitment as the old-time speculator made when he bought\nWoolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely for their earning power\nand future prospects.\nIt is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which\nsaw IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earn-\nings enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous specu-\nlative aspects of our large industrial companies have tended to\ndisappear, or at least to diminish greatly.

It\nwas a simple matter to consult the records and to present the true\nearnings of Consolidated Gas in a magazine article. (Incidentally,\nthe addition to profits was not spectacular.) One of my older\nfriends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy to\nsupply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you\nfor nothing. Consolidated Gas with the mystery is both more inter-\nesting and more valuable than ex-mystery. You youngsters who\nwant to stick your noses into everything are going to ruin Wall\nStreet.”\nIt is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to\nthe speculative fires have now all but disappeared. These were\nMystery, Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security ana-\nlysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are\nso speculative in themselves as to pretty well take the place of\nthose older speculative factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s”\nnow—none other than Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing\nCompany—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the\nnew speculation as contrasted with the old? Consider a few fig-\nures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the market\nwas valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show\nno increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at\n$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and a\ncool $11⁄ billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”\n2\nWedo not know the process of calculation by which that valuation\nof good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later\nthe market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,\nor about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-\nrately the intangible component of a splendid company such as\nthis. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-\ntant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-\ntain becomes the true value of the enterprise, and therefore the\nmore speculative inherently the common stock.\nIt may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed\nin the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-\nlier times with today.

A good industrial company might be\nrequired to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible\nassets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its\nexcess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be\nvalued on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximately\nthese ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-\nmon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap-\npened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these\nrelationships may now be seen. A company must now typically\nearn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the\naverage market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10\nper cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a higher\nmultiplier, than the base earnings required to support the book\nvalue in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent on the\nequity may well sell at 131⁄ times earnings, or twice its net assets.\n2\nThis would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-\nued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be\ncalled the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.\nNow there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-\ndure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-\ntions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given these\nliberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,\nand the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more\ncogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand in\nhand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really\npaid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not\nthe good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name\nand a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-\ntations of increased profits in the future.\nThis brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of\nthe new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shall\ntouch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests\nshow, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—\ni.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-\nmetical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase\ndirectly as the square of the earnings, but inverselythe book value.\nThus in an important and very real sense tangible assets have\nbecome a drag on average market value rather than a source\nwww.fx1618.com",

Thus it would\nnot be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets for\nCompany B are responsible for the $25 per share lower market\nprice, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.\nBut more important than the foregoing is the general relation-\nship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.\nGiven the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the\nrate of earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this\ngrowth into the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of com-\npound interest—lo! the security analyst is supplied with a new\nkind of philosopher’s stone which can produce or justify any\ndesired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in a\nrecent article in the Analysts’Journalon the vogue of higher mathe-\nmatics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition of\nthe striking analogy between value calculations of growth stocks\nand the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged and\nconfused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The\npoint I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the\nrelationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on\ncommon stocks, which is this: Mathematics is ordinarily consid-\nered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock\nmarket the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more\nuncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.\nIn forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never\nseen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\nrelated investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or\nthe most elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in,\nor higher algebra, you could take it as a warning signal that the\noperator was trying to substitute theory for experience, and usu-\nally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.\nThe older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite\nnaïve to the sophisticated security analyst of today.

Now this was a perfectly true and\neven valuable discovery, but it was true only because nobody paid\nany attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke up to\nthe historical merits of common stocks as long-term investments,\nthey soon ceased to have any such merit, because the public’s\nenthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built-\nin margin of safety, and thus drove them out of the investment\nclass. Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,\nand we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring\n(in 1931) that no common stock could everbe an investment.\nWhen we view this long-range experience in perspective we\nfind another set of paradoxes in the investor’s changing attitude\ntoward capital gains as contrasted with income.

Such common stocks\ncould be bought at most times, except in the upper ranges of a bull\nmarket, at moderate prices in relation to their indicated intrinsic\nvalues. As a matter of fact, because of the present tendency of\ninvestors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorous\nissues, I should hazard the statement that these middle-ground\nstocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independently\ndeterminable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety factor sup-\nplied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to\ndestroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues. Further-\nmore, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for\npenetrating analysis of the past record and for discriminating\nchoice in the area of future prospects, to which can be added the\nhigher assurance of safety conferred by diversification.\nWhen Phaëthon insisted on driving the chariot of the Sun, his\nfather, the experienced operator, gave the neophyte some advice\nwhich the latter failed to follow—to his cost.

At the high price soon after issuance the heedless public was\npaying much more per dollar of earnings and assets than for most\nof our large and strong companies. This example is admittedly\nextreme, but it is far from unique; the instances of lesser, but inex-\ncusable, overvaluations run into the hundreds.\nSequel 1965–1970\nIn 1965 new interests came into the company. The unprofitable\nbuilding-maintenance business was sold out, and the company em-\nbarked in an entirely different venture: making electronic devices.\nThe name was changed to Haydon Switch and Instrument Co. The\nearnings results have not been impressive. In the five years\n1965–1969 the enterprise showed average earnings of only 8 cents\nper share of “old stock,” with 34 cents earned in the best year, 1967.\nHowever, in true modern style, the company split the stock 2 for 1 in\n1968. The market price also ran true to Wall Street form. It advanced\nfrom 7⁄ in 1964 to the equivalent of 161⁄ in 1968 (after the split). The\n8 2\nprice now exceeded the record set in the enthusiastic days of 1961.\nThis time the overvaluation was much worse than before. The stock\nwas now selling at 52 times the earnings of its only good year, and\nsome 200 times its average earnings. Also, the company was again to\nreport a deficit in the very year that the new high price was estab-\nlished. The next year, 1969, the bid price fell to $1.\nQUESTIONS: Did the idiots who paid $8+ for this stock in 1968\nknow anything at all about the company’s previous history, its\nfive-year earnings record, its asset value (very small)? Did they\nhave any idea of how much—or rather how little—they were get-\nting for their money? Did they care? Has anyone on Wall Street any\nresponsibility at all for the regular recurrence of completely brain-\nless, shockingly widespread, and inevitable catastrophic specula-\ntion in this kind of vehicle?\n6.

The initial market value of the\nbonds appears to have been only 43% of par, while the warrants\nwere quoted at $10 per NVF share involved. This meant that the\nSharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-\nrants for each share turned in, a total of $45 per share. (This was\nabout the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price\nfor the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-\nference between this book value and the market value of Sharon\nstock amounted to about $21 million on the 1,415,000 shares of\nSharon acquired.\n2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three\nthings: (a) To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a\n“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from\nincome for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.\n(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest on\nthe “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b)To offset this\nbond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-\ning of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the\ncost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This\nwould correspond, in reverse fashion, to the required practice of\nchargingincome each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-\ntions in excess of the book value of the assets acquired.) (c) The\nbeauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save\ninitially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes from\nthese two annual entries, because the amortization of bond dis-\ncount could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization\nof “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-\nable income.\n3. This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consoli-\ndated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF\nfor 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of\nSharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-\nessary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of\nthe common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no other\nthat we know, the warrants were assigned a substantial value in\nthe balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatory\nnote).\nwww.fx1618.com",

In March 1972 the DJIAwas again at 940 after an intervening\ndecline to 798. Again, Graham was right.

It suspended\ninterest payments on its income bonds, and the price of the 5% issue\nfell to 10.\n2. For example: Cities Service $6 first preferred, not paying dividends,\nsold at as low as 15 in 1937 and at 27 in 1943, when the accumulations\nhad reached $60 per share. In 1947 it was retired by exchange for\n$196.50 of 3% debentures for each share, and it sold as high as 186.\n3. An elaborate statistical study carried on under the direction of the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research indicates that such has actu-\nally been the case. Graham is referring to W. Braddock Hickman,\nCorporate Bond Quality and Investor Experience (Princeton University\nPress, 1958). Hickman’s book later inspired Michael Milken of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert to offer massive high-yield financing to companies\nwith less than sterling credit ratings, helping to ignite the leveraged-\nbuyout and hostile takeover craze of the late 1980s.\n4. A representative sample of 41 such issues taken from Standard &\nPoor’s Stock Guide shows that five lost 90% or more of their high\nprice, 30 lost more than half, and the entire group about two-thirds.\nThe many not listed in the Stock Guide undoubtedly had a larger\nshrinkage on the whole.\nChapter 7.

A company with an ordinary record cannot, without confusing the\nterm, be called a growth company or a “growth stock” merely\nbecause its proponent expects it to do better than the average in the\nfuture. It is just a “promising company.” Graham is making a subtle but\nimportant point: If the definition of a growth stock is a company that will\nthrive in the future, then that’s not a definition at all, but wishful thinking.\nIt’s like calling a sports team “the champions” before the season is over.\nThis wishful thinking persists today; among mutual funds, “growth” port-\nfolios describe their holdings as companies with “above-average growth\nwww.fx1618.com",

Two studies are available. The first, made by H. G. Schneider, one of\nour students, covers the years 1917–1950 and was published in June\n1951 in the Journal of Finance. The second was made by Drexel Fire-\nstone, members of the New York Stock Exchange, and covers the\nyears 1933–1969. The data are given here by their kind permission.\n6.

The new competition, in turn, will\nlead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point was over-\nlooked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that early\nwinners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.\nChapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy\n1. Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid\nout in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-\nket price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was\nwell illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of years\nbefore 1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earn-\nings, and proved to be especially attractive buys because their divi-\ndends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much\nmore uniform for the industry.\nChapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept\nof Investment\n1. This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative\nOpportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” Analysts’ Journal, third\nquarter 1947.\nPostscript\n1. Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through\nbecause the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would\nbe 100% covered by asset value. Afuture $300 million or more in mar-\nket gain turned on, say, $50,000 of accounting items. By dumb luck\nthey got what they insisted on.\nAppendixes\n1.

Buffett\nI\nread the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine-\nteen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing\never written. I still think it is.\nTo invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-\nspheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.\nWhat’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-\nsions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-\nwork. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper\nframework. You must supply the emotional discipline.\nIf you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra-\nham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable\nadvice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from\nyour investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment\nthan you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results\nwill depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-\nments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-\nvail during your investing career. The sillier the market’s behavior,\nthe greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow\nGraham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.\nTo me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher.\nMore than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.\nShortly after Ben’s death in 1976, I wrote the following short\nremembrance about him in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you\nread the book, I believe you’ll perceive some of the qualities I men-\ntioned in this tribute.\nwww.fx1618.com\nviiiix Preface to the Fourth Edition\nBENJAMIN GRAHAM\n1894–1976\nSeveral years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend\nthe thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish, something\ncreative and something generous.”\nThe inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-\naging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or\nself-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was\nunfailingly gentle.\nReaders of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as\nmeasured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-\npline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.\nBut over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure\nand logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-\nsible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security\nanalysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months\nafter publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often\nenhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that\ndemolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness\nbrought unfailing rewards to his followers—even to those with natural\nabilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-\ning counsels of brilliance or fashion.\nAremarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was\nthat he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-\ntrates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of\nan intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have\nnever met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,\nunending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a\nform applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his\nthinking in any field a delight.\nBut his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond\nall others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each\nrelationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there\nwas an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,\nand spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to\ngo. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.\nWalter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit\nunder. Ben Graham was such a man.\nReprintewd fwromw t.hfex F1in6an1cia8l .Acnoalymsts Journal,November/December 1976.A Note About Benjamin Graham\nby Jason Zweig\nW\nho was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?\nGraham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was\nalso the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,\nmoney managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by\nsuperstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis\nwas the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-\nfession.1\nAnd The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for\nindividual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that\nare essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on\ninvesting ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor\nwas the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub\nreporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner\nor later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-\nfered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,\nafter the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market\nthat began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investorreads more prophet-\nically than ever.)\nGraham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the\nanguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and\npsychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on\nMay 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and\nfigurines.2The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At\nfirst they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-\n1Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.\n2The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,\nwhenw Gwermwan.f-sxo1un6d1ing8 n.acmoems were regarded with suspicion.\nxxi A Note About Benjamin Graham\nerness—on upper Fifth Avenue. But Ben’s father died in 1903, the\nporcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.\nBen’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-\ning money to trade stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash\nof 1907. For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of\ncashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is\nDorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”\nFortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his\nbrilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his\nclass. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—\nEnglish, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the faculty.\nHe was all of 20 years old.\nInstead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.\nHe started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,\nthen a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-\nnership.\nThe Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In\nApril 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for\nSavold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by\nOctober, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock\nwas worthless.\nGraham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,\nalmost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure\nreports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-\nmission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $65\nper share—held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He\nbought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and\ncame away with $110 per share three years later.)\nDespite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of\n1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting\nbargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact\nrecord of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in\n1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,\nversus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-\nterm track records on Wall Street history.3\n3Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)\nthat Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his\nown righwt.

Combining his extraordinary intellectual\npowers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham\ndeveloped his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they\nwere during his lifetime:\n• A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an\nownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value\nthat does not depend on its share price.\n• The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-\nable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified\npessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor\nis a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.\n• The future value of every investment is a function of its present\nprice. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.\n• No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever\neliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what\nGraham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-\nter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize\nyour odds of error.\n• The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you\nbecome a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,\nand you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady\nadvantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your\ndiscipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood\nswings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-\nments behave is much less important than how you behave.\nThe goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investoris to apply\nGraham’s ideas to today’s financial markets while leaving his text\nentirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4 After\neach of Graham’s chapters you’ll find a new commentary.

Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of\nanalyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment\nprinciples and investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a\nnumber of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in\npairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—\nin order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements\ninvolved in specific choices of common stocks.\nBut much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns\nof financial markets, in some cases running back over many\ndecades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-\narmed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of\nbonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-\ntions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s\nown experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to\nWall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do\nnot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”\nOur text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-\ntors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all\nbut forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a\n“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to\nriches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up\nwhat we have just said by a bit of financial history—especially\nsince there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-\nmactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally\nas well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an\narticle in the Ladies’Home Journal,entitled “Everybody Ought to Be\nwww.fx1618.com\n12 Introduction\nRich.”* His thesis was that savings of only $15 per month invested\nin good common stocks—with dividends reinvested—would pro-\nduce an estate of $80,000 in twenty years against total contributions\nof only $3,600. If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was\nindeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our\nrough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks\nmaking up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates\nthat if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,\nthe investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been\nworth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise\nof $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such\noptimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should\nremark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation\nwould have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this\ndespite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases\nwith the DJIAat 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948\nclosing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive\nargument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong\ncommon stocks through thick and thin—a program known as\n“dollar-cost averaging.”\nSince our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant\nfor those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided\nby charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the\nright moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to\nnearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should\nbuybecausea stock or the market has gone up and one should sell\nbecauseit has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business\nsense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to\n*Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-\npany, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He also\nserved as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the driving\nforce behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by\nfinance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s plan would have\ngrown to just under $9,000 after 20 years, although inflation would have\neaten away much of that gain. For the best recent look at Raskob’s views on\nlong-term stock investing, see the essay by financial adviser William Bern-\nstein at www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.\nwww.fx1618.comWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish 3\nlasting success on Wall Street. In our own stock-market experience\nand observation, extending over 50 years, we have not known a\nsingle person who has consistently or lastingly made money by\nthus “following the market.” We do not hesitate to declare that this\napproach is as fallacious as it is popular. We shall illustrate what\nwe have just said—though, of course this should not be taken as\nproof—by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow theory for\ntrading in the stock market.*\nSince its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent\nInvestorhave appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In\nupdating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a\nnumber of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.\nThese include:\n1. An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade\nbonds.\n2. A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common\nstocks, ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage\ndecline in some 30 years. (Countless issues of lower quality\nhad a much larger shrinkage.)\n3. A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices,\nwhich gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-\neral business in 1970.\n4. The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, fran-\nchise operations, and other relative novelties in business and\nfinance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as “let-\nter stock,”1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading\nnames, use of foreign banks, and others.)†\n*Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and pp. 191–192.\nFor more detail on the Dow Theory, see http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/\ndow/dowpage.html.\n†Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then immedi-\nately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s definition\non p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report unsustainably high\nreturns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\ncracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund\ninvestors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.\nwww.fx1618.com4 Introduction\n5. Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-\nterm debt of many formerly strongly entrenched companies,\nand even a disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street\nhouses.*\n6. The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of\ninvestment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,\nwith disquieting results.\nThese phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some\nwill require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-\nous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should\nnot alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-\nples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-\nnisms and climate.\nThe last statement was put to the test during the writing of the\npresent edition, the first draft of which was finished in January\n1971. At that time the DJIAwas in a strong recovery from its 1970\nlow of 632 and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with\nattendant general optimism. As the last draft was finished, in\nNovember 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-\nrying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its\nfuture. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general\nattitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-\ntially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.\nThe extent of the market’s shrinkage in 1969–70 should have\nserved to dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground dur-\ning the past two decades. This was that leading common stocks\ncould be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not\nonly of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon\nbe recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-\n*The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in the\nUnited States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970—shocking\ninvestors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see\np. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham had in mind\nwere Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see pp. 425 and\n463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged between 1968\nand 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went bust.\nwww.fx1618.comWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish 5\nels. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has\n“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock\ninvestors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-\nhaps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.\nIn the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,\nespecially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the\nlast market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in\nitself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there\nwas now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment\nfunds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously\novervalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who\nneeds to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for\ngreat accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-\nably leads to disaster.\nThe major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the\nhuge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967\nthe investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much\nincome from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-\ntive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%\non highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.\n(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of\n1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949\nthe figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only\n2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2In previous editions we have\nconsistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s\nportfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general\na 50–50 division between the two media. We must now consider\nwhether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock\nyields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-\ntionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-\ntinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision\nhere. Achapter will be devoted to this discussion.*\n* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-\ning in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all that\ndifferent from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generated\nby top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.\nwww.fx1618.com6 Introduction\nIn the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds\nof investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive”\nand the “enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will\nplace his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or\nlosses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and\nthe need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of\nthe enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness\nto devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both\nsound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades\nan enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile\nreward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average\nreturn than that realized by the passive investor. We have some\ndoubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to\nthe active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the\nyears after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to\ndevote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as\nthey existed in former periods and may return.\nIt has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-\nful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that\nare most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the\nmost promising companies in these industries. For example, smart\ninvestors—or their smart advisers—would long ago have recog-\nnized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a\nwhole and of International Business Machines in particular. And\nsimilarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-\npanies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To\nbring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that\nwe included first in the 1949 edition of this book.\nSuch an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport\nstocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than\nthe trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the\nvalue of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls\nlurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive\ntechnique that will help him along his path.*\n*“Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement in the late\n1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later. Among\nthe hottewst wmuwtu.aflx fu1n6ds1 o8f .thcaot mera were Aeronautical Securities and theWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish 7\nThe pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry\nwe mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of\nair traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this\nfactor their shares became a favorite choice of the investment\nfunds. But despite the expansion of revenues—at a pace even\ngreater than in the computer industry—a combination of techno-\nlogical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-\ning and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a\nnew high in traffic figures, the airlines sustained a loss of some\n$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in\n1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a\ngreater decline in 1969–70 than did the general market. The record\nshows that even the highly paid full-time experts of the mutual\nfunds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of\na major and nonesoteric industry.\nOn the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial\ninvestments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its\napparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about\nits rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%\nof their funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of\nthis excellent choice on their overall results was by no means\ndecisive. Furthermore, many—if not most—of their investments in\ncomputer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been\nunprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals\nfor our readers:\n1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not\ntranslate into obvious profits for investors.\n2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and\nconcentrating on the most promising companies in the most\npromising industries.\nMissiles-Rockets-Jets & Automation Fund. They, like the stocks they owned,\nturned out to be an investing disaster. It is commonly accepted today that\nthe cumulative earnings of the airline industry over its entire history have\nbeen negative. The lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid\nbuying airline stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty”\nthat awnyw inwdus.ftrxy 1w6ill 1ou8tp.ecrfoormm all others in the future.8 Introduction\nThe author did not follow this approach in his financial career as\nfund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much\nencouragement to those who may wish to try it.\nWhat then will we aim to accomplish in this book? Our main\nobjective will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible\nsubstantial error and to develop policies with which he will be\ncomfortable. We shall say quite a bit about the psychology of\ninvestors. For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his\nworst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is\nnot in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves....”) This\nhas proved the more true over recent decades as it has become\nmore necessary for conservative investors to acquire common\nstocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement\nand the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,\nand exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper\nmental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.\nWehave seen much more money made and keptby “ordinary peo-\nple” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment\nprocess than by those who lacked this quality, even though they\nhad an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-\nmarket lore.\nAdditionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to\nmeasure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at\nsome price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price\nthey would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-\ning what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in\ninvestment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago\nwe advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-\nceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses\nof the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were\nrealized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to\nask “How much?”\nIn June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by\nthe magic figure 9.40%—the yield obtainable on new offerings of\nhigh-grade public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about\n7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other\nanswer?” But there are other possible answers, and these must be\ncarefully considered. Besides which, we repeat that both we and\nour readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif-\nferent cownwditwio.nfsx o1f,6 sa1y8, 1.9c7o3–m1977.What This Book Expects to Accomplish 9\nWeshall therefore present in some detail a positive program for\ncommon-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of\nboth classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter-\nprising group. Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our\nchief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues\nselling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for\nthis seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-\ncal. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good\ngrowth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of\nsuch shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations\nof the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of\npublic-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always\nconsider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding\nbusinesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what the\nstock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such\na conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting\nadventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated\ngrowth.\nThe art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally\nappreciated. Acreditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved\nby the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to\nimprove this easily attainable standard requires much application\nand more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a\nlittleextra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment\nprogram, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you\nmay well find that you have done worse.\nSince anyone—by just buying and holding a representative\nlist—can equal the performance of the market averages, it would\nseem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as\na matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail\nis surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds,\nwith all their experienced personnel, have not performed so well\n*Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real estate,\nfactories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (such\nas cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable).

Allied to the foregoing\nis the record of the published stock-market predictions of the\nbrokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated\nforecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing\nof a coin.\nIn writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of\ninvestment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have\nbeen emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-\nsified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carry\nout with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe\nand sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-\ning difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before\nattempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself\nand of his advisers—particularly as to whether they have a clear\nconcept of the differences between investment and speculation and\nbetween market price and underlying value.\nA strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the\nmargin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a\ndecision to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured\nfruits of defensive investment should not be made without much\nself-examination.\nA final retrospective thought. When the young author entered\nWall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next\nhalf-century had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect\nthat a World War was to break out in two months, and close down\nthe New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the\nrichest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sorts\nof major problems and more apprehensive than confident of the\nfuture. Yet if we confine our attention to American investment\nexperience, there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last 57\nyears. Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-\nshaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound\ninvestment principles produced generally sound results. We must\nact on the assumption that they will continue to do so.\nNote to the Reader:This book does not address itself to the overall\nfinancial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that\nportion of their funds which they are prepared to place in mar-\nketable (or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks.\nwww.fx1618.comWhat This Book Expects to Accomplish 11\nConsequently we do not discuss such important media as savings\nand time desposits, savings-and-loan-association accounts, life\ninsurance, annuities, and real-estate mortgages or equity owner-\nship. The reader should bear in mind that when he finds the word\n“now,” or the equivalent, in the text, it refers to late 1971 or\nearly 1972.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION\nIf you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;\nthat is where they should be. Now put the foundations under\nthem.\n—Henry David Thoreau,Walden\nN\notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not\ntell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.\nInstead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:\n• how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;\n• how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;\n• how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most\ninvestors from reaching their full potential.\nBack in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks\nseemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could\nlose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,\nmany of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value\nor more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%\njust to get back to where you started.1 Taking a foolish risk can put\nyou so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’s\nwhy Graham constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding\nlosses—not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-\ning that he has woven throughout his entire text.\nBut no matter how careful you are, the price of your investments\nwill go down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,\n1To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are likely to\nbuy a stock at $30 and be able to sell it at $600.\nwww.fx1618.com\n12Commentary on the Introduction 13\nGraham will show you how to manage it—and how to get your fears\nunder control.\nARE YOU AN INTELLIGENT INVESTOR?\nNow let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-\nham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this\nbook, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of\nintelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means\nbeing patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to\nharness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,\nexplains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.”2\nThere’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to\nmake an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management\nL.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer\nscientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than\n$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market\nwould return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming\nmore and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money\nthat its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.3\nAnd back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in\nthe South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that\nthe market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that\nhe “could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the\nmadness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-\neting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in\nthe wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much\nhigher price—and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today’s\nmoney). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words\n“South Sea” in his presence.4\n2Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor(Harper & Row, 1949), p. 4.\n3A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the government,\ninvested aggressively for wealthy clients. For a superb telling of the LTCM\nstory, see Roger Lowenstein, When Genius Failed(Random House, 2000).\n4John Carswell, The South Sea Bubble (Cresset Press, London, 1960),\npp. 131, 199. Also see www.harvard-magazine.com/issues/mj99/damnd.\nhtml.\nwww.fx1618.com14 Commentary on the Introduction\nSir Isaac Newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever\nlived, as most of us would define intelligence. But, in Graham’s terms,\nNewton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the\ncrowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted\nlike a fool.\nIn short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’re\nstupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed the\nemotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,\nGraham describes how to enhance your intelligence by harnessing\nyour emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-\nity. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is\nmore a matter of “character” than “brain.”\nA CHRONICLE OF CALAMITY\nNow let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-\nopments of the past few years:\n1. The worst market crash since the Great Depression, with U.S.\nstocks losing 50.2% of their value—or $7.4 trillion—between\nMarch 2000 and October 2002.\n2. Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of\nthe 1990s, including AOL, Cisco, JDS Uniphase, Lucent, and\nQualcomm—plus the utter destruction of hundreds of Internet\nstocks.\n3.

An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace\nof global terrorism and war in the Middle East.\nMuch of this damage could have been (and was!) avoided by\ninvestors who learned and lived by Graham’s principles. As Graham\nputs it, “while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplish-\nments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”\nBy letting themselves get carried away—on Internet stocks, on big\n“growth” stocks, on stocks as a whole—many people made the same\nstupid mistakes as Sir Isaac Newton. They let other investors’ judg-\nments determine their own. They ignored Graham’s warning that “the\nreally dreadful losses” always occur after “the buyer forgot to ask\n‘How much?’” Most painfully of all, by losing their self-control just\nwhen they needed it the most, these people proved Graham’s asser-\ntion that “the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is\nlikely to be himself.”\nTHE SURE THING THAT WASN’T\nMany of those people got especially carried away on technology and\nInternet stocks, believing the high-tech hype that this industry would\nkeep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:\n• In mid-1999, after earning a 117.3% return in just the first five\nmonths of the year, Monument Internet Fund portfolio manager\nAlexander Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year\nover the next three to five years and an annual average of 35%\n“over the next 20 years.”5\n5Constance Loizos, “Q&A: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews,May 17, 1999,\np. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history was 25.8% per year,\nachieved by the legendary Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan over the two\ndecades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s performance turned $10,000\ninto more than $982,000 in 20 years. Cheung was predicting that his fund\nwould turn $10,000 into more than $4 million over the same length of time.\nInstead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously overoptimistic, investors threw\nwww.fx1618.com16 Commentary on the Introduction\n• After his Amerindo Technology Fund rose an incredible 248.9%\nin 1999, portfolio manager Alberto Vilar ridiculed anyone who\ndared to doubt that the Internet was a perpetual moneymaking\nmachine: “If you’re out of this sector, you’re going to underper-\nform. You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You\ndon’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone\nelse.”6\n• In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer pro-\nclaimed that Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth\nowning right now.” These “winners of the new world,” as he called\nthem, “are the only ones that are going higher consistently in\ngood days and bad.” Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: “You\nhave to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that\nexisted before the Web....If we used any of what Graham and\nDodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under management.”7\nAll these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warn-\ning: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not\ntranslate into obvious profits for investors.” While it seems easy to\nforesee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real\nvalue if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By\nthe time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best\nmoney at him, flinging more than $100 million into his fund over the next\nyear. A $10,000 investment in the Monument Internet Fund in May 1999\nwould have shrunk to roughly $2,000 by year-end 2002. (The Monument\nfund no longer exists in its original form and is now known as Orbitex\nEmerging Technology Fund.)\n6Lisa Reilly Cullen, “The Triple Digit Club,” Money,December, 1999, p. 170.\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999, you would\nhave finished 2002 with just $1,195 left—one of the worst destructions of\nwealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.\n7See www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html. Cramer’s favorite\nstocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By year-end\n2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a $10,000 investment\nspread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%, leaving you\nwith a grand total of $597.44.

But make sure you\nremember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing”\nwill be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely\nto be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.\nTHE SILVER LINING\nIf no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve\nreached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The\npendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational\nexuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27\nbillion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-\nrities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cut\nback on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to\nbuy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,\ntherefore, becoming expensive—sold stocks as they went down in\nprice and, by definition, became cheaper.\nAs Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly back-\nwards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,\nnot less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices\nfall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks\nmore costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash\non hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear\nmarket, since it puts stocks back on sale.8\nSo take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news\neveryone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now\nis a considerably safer—and saner—time to be building wealth. Read\non, and let Graham show you how.\n8The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced stage of\nretirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even an\nelderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone\ndown in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones\nbut deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs\nfor tax purposes.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 1\nInvestment versus Speculation: Results to\nBe Expected by the Intelligent Investor\nT\nhis chapter will outline the viewpoints that will be set forth in\nthe remainder of the book. In particular we wish to develop at the\noutset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ-\nual, nonprofessional investor.\nInvestment versus Speculation\nWhat do we mean by “investor”? Throughout this book the\nterm will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far back\nas 1934, in our textbook Security Analysis,1 we attempted a precise\nformulation of the difference between the two, as follows: “An\ninvestment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-\nises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not\nmeeting these requirements are speculative.”\nWhile we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the\nensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that\nhave occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.\nAfter the great market decline of 1929–1932 all common stocks\nwere widely regarded as speculative by nature. (Aleading author-\nity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.2)\nThus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that\nit gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.\nNow our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our\nreaders from accepting the common jargon which applies the term\n“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market. In our\nlast edition we cited the following headline of a front-page article\nof our leading financial journal in June 1962:\nwww.fx1618.com\n18Investment versus Speculation 19\nSMALLINVESTORS BEARISH, THEYARE SELLING ODD-LOTS SHORT\nIn October 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it\ncalled “reckless investors,” who this time were rushing in on the\nbuying side.\nThese quotations well illustrate the confusion that has been\ndominant for many years in the use of the words investment and\nspeculation. Think of our suggested definition of investment given\nabove, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an\ninexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what\nhe is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he\nwill be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-\nevant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market\nhad already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-\nting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time\nas possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used\nphrase “reckless investors” could be regarded as a laughable con-\ntradiction in terms—something like “spendthrift misers”—were\nthis misuse of language not so mischievous.\nThe newspaper employed the word “investor” in these\ninstances because, in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone\nwho buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of\nwhat he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for\ncash or on margin. Compare this with the attitude of the public\ntoward common stocks in 1948, when over 90% of those queried\nexpressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common\nstocks.3About half gave as their reason “not safe, a gamble,” and\nabout half, the reason “not familiar with.”* It is indeed ironical\n*The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of\nMichigan and was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July, 1948.\nPeople were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He\ncan either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think\nwould be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays—put it in\nthe bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common\nstock with it?” Only 4% thought common stock would offer a “satisfactory”\nreturn; 26% considered it “not safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through\n1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,\nwww.fx1618.com20 The Intelligent Investor\n(though not surprising) that common-stock purchases of all kinds\nwere quite generally regarded as highly speculative or risky at a\ntime when they were selling on a most attractive basis, and due\nsoon to begin their greatest advance in history; conversely the very\nfact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev-\nels as judged by past experiencelater transformed them into “invest-\nments,” and the entire stock-buying public into “investors.”\nThe distinction between investment and speculation in common\nstocks has always been a useful one and its disappearance is a\ncause for concern. We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-\ntion would be well advised to reinstate this distinction and to\nemphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock\nexchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,\nwhich those who suffered them had not been properly warned\nagainst. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-\nrassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from\nthe inclusion of speculative common stocks in their own capital\nfunds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably\nclear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-\nments—risks which are inseparable from the opportunities of\nprofit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the\ninvestor’s calculations.\nWhat we have just said indicates that there may no longer be\nsuch a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-\nsentative common stocks—in the sense that one can always wait to\nbuy them at a price that involves no risk of a market or “quota-\ntional” loss large enough to be disquieting. In most periods the\ninvestor must recognize the existence of a speculative factor in his\ncommon-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component\nwithin minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-\nically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.\nTwo paragraphs should be added about stock speculation per\nse, as distinguished from the speculative component now inherent\naveraging 18.7% annually. In a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a\npoll conducted by BusinessWeekat year-end 2002 found that only 24% of\ninvestors were willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios,\ndown from 47% just three years earlier.\nwww.fx1618.comInvestment versus Speculation 21\nin most representative common stocks. Outright speculation is\nneither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the\npocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and\nunavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-\nstantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein\nmust be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as\nthere is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which\nspeculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1)\nspeculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-\nously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge\nand skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you\ncan afford to lose.\nIn our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates\non margin† should recognize that he is ipso factospeculating, and it\nis his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a\nso-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any\nway similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation\nis always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead\nof the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—\nthe smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this\npurpose. Never add more money to this account just because the\n*Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without speculation, untested\nnew companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier times, the Edison Electric\nLight Co.) would never be able to raise the necessary capital for expansion.\nThe alluring, long-shot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates\nthe machinery of innovation. Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never elimi-\nnated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary\nrisk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual\nrisk—the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!\n†A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow\nfrom the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more\nwhen your stocks go up—but you can be wiped out when they go down. The\ncollateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your account—so you\nmust put up more money if that value falls below the amount you borrowed.\nFor more information about margin accounts, see www.sec.gov/investor/\npubs/margin.htm, www.sia.com/publications/pdf/MarginsA.pdf, and www.\nnyse.com/pdfs/2001_factbook_09.pdf.\nwww.fx1618.com22 The Intelligent Investor\nmarket has gone up and profits are rolling in.

Never mingle\nyour speculative and investment operations in the same account,\nnor in any part of your thinking.\nResults to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor\nWe have already defined the defensive investor as one inter-\nested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother. In general what\ncourse should he follow and what return can he expect under\n“average normal conditions”—if such conditions really exist? To\nanswer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on\nthe subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have\noccurred since then in the underlying factors governing the\ninvestor’s expectable return, and finally what he should do and\nwhat he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.\n1. What We Said Six Years Ago\nWerecommended that the investor divide his holdings between\nhigh-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion\nheld in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the\nconverse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;\nthat his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion\nbetween the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when\nmarket developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As\nan alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock\ncomponent to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,”\nand conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he\nfelt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly\nattractive.”\nIn 1965 the investor could obtain about 41⁄% on high-grade tax-\n2\nable bonds and 31⁄% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return\n4\non leading common stocks (with the DJIAat 892) was only about\n3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at\nnormal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain\nan initial dividend return of between 31⁄% and 41⁄% on his stock\n2 2\npurchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-\ning value (and in the “normal market price”) of a representative\nwww.fx1618.comInvestment versus Speculation 23\nstock list of about the same amount, giving a return from divi-\ndends and appreciation combined of about 71⁄% per year. The half\n2\nand half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%\nbefore income tax. We added that the stock component should\ncarry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power\ncaused by large-scale inflation.\nIt should be pointed out that the above arithmetic indicated\nexpectation of a much lower rate of advance in the stock market\nthan had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-\naged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it\nwas quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly\nsatisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people\nwere willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate\nof advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”\nand hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not\nvery good but badresults for the future.”4\n2. What Has Happened Since 1964\nThe major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on\nfirst-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since\nbeen a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The\nobtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 71⁄% and\n2\neven more against 41⁄% in 1964. In the meantime the dividend\n2\nreturn on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-\nket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is\nless than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going\ninterest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the\nmarket price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this\nperiod.\nThere is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we\ndiscussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be\ntoo high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not\nconsider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to\nthe price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we\nknow of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary\nwidely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light\nof what has since happened we think that this warning—with\nattendant examples—was insufficiently stressed. For the fact is that\nwww.fx1618.com24 The Intelligent Investor\nif the investor had a given sum in the DJIAat its closing price of\n874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971;\neven at the lowest level (631) in 1970 his indicated loss would have\nbeen less than that shown on good long-term bonds. On the other\nhand, if he had confined his bond-type investments to U.S. savings\nbonds, short-term corporate issues, or savings accounts, he would\nhave had no loss in market value of his principal during this period\nand he would have enjoyed a higher income return than was\noffered by good stocks. It turned out, therefore, that true “cash\nequivalents” proved to be better investments in 1964 than common\nstocks—in spite of the inflation experience that in theory should\nhave favored stocks over cash. The decline in quoted principal\nvalue of good longer-term bonds was due to developments in the\nmoney market, an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an\nimportant bearing on the investment policy of individuals.\nThis is just another of an endless series of experiences over time\nthat have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never\npredictable.* Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than\nstock prices, and investors generally could buy good bonds of any\nmaturity without having to worry about changes in their market\nvalue. There were a few exceptions to this rule, and the period after\n1964 proved to be one of them. We shall have more to say about\nchange in bond prices in a later chapter.\n3. Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972\nToward the end of 1971 it was possible to obtain 8% taxable\ninterest on good medium-term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free\non good state or municipal securities. In the shorter-term field the\ninvestor could realize about 6% on U.S. government issues due in\nfive years. In the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about\n*Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of investing\nexperts is saying: The future of security prices is never predictable. And as\nyou read ahead in the book, notice how everything else Graham tells you is\ndesigned to help you grapple with that truth. Since you cannot predict the\nbehavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own\nbehavior.\nwww.fx1618.comInvestment versus Speculation 25\na possible loss in market value, since he is sure of full repayment,\nincluding the 6% interest return, at the end of a comparatively\nshort holding period. The DJIAat its recurrent price level of 900 in\n1971 yields only 3.5%.\nLet us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision\nto be made is how to divide the fund between high-grade bonds\n(or other so-called “cash equivalents”) and leading DJIA-type\nstocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-\nditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant\nupward or a significant downward movement for some time in the\nfuture? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse\nchange, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-\nrent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average\nannual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this\nappreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-\nous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-\ntributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his\nstocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-\nest on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return\non stocks would work out at some 5.3%.5This would be about the\nsame as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.\nThese expectations are much less favorable for stocks against\nbonds than they were in our 1964 analysis. (That conclusion fol-\nlows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up\nmuch more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight\n*How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems, very\nwell: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned\nan annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period\nfor his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-\nyear time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this\nperiod, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his\nchapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation,”\nwhich essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the\ncurrent dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield\nof just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around\n2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly\n6% is plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)\nwww.fx1618.com26 The Intelligent Investor\nof the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds\nare much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-\ndends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are\nforced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bond\ninvestment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If we\ncould be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise\nthe defensive investor to put all his money in bonds and none in\ncommon stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-\ncantly in favor of stocks.\nBut of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-\nter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediately\nthink of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In\nthe next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experience\nwith inflation in the United States during this century would not\nsupport the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials\nin yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider it\nremote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another\nwould have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a\nfixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—\nwhich we also consider highly unlikely—that American business\nwill become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-\ntify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.\nFinally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness\nanother great speculative rise in the stock market without a real\njustification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, and\nperhaps others we haven’t thought of, might cause the investor to\nregret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable\nyield levels.\nHence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-\nations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy\n*Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were\nintroduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice\nfor investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise\nin value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing the\ninvestor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee\nand, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For\nmore details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)\nwww.fx1618.comInvestment versus Speculation 27\nfor defensive investors—namely that at all times they have a signif-\nicant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant\npart also in equities. It is still true that they may choose between\nmaintaining a simple 50–50 division between the two components\nor a ratio, dependent on their judgment, varying between a mini-\nmum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of either. We shall give our\nmore detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.\nSince at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks\nis nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectable\nreturn (including growth of stock values) for the investor would\nchange little regardless of how he divides his fund between the\ntwo components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from\nboth parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free\n(or estimated tax-paid) basis. Areturn of this order is appreciably\nhigher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over\nmost of the long-term past. It may not seem attractive in relation to\nthe 14%, or so, return shown by common stocks during the 20\nyears of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be\nremembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIAhad\nadvanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had\nabout doubled. Hence the greater part of the impressive market\nrecord for that period was based on a change in investors’ and\nspeculators’ attitudes rather than in underlying corporate values.\nTo that extent it might well be called a “bootstrap operation.”\nIn discussing the common-stock portfolio of the defensive\ninvestor, we have spoken only of leading issues of the type\nincluded in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-\nage. We have done this for convenience, and not to imply that these\n30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him. Actually, there are\nmany other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average\nof the Dow Jones list; these would include a host of public utilities\n(which have a separate Dow Jones average to represent them).* But\n*Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage are the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index (the “S & P”) and the\nWilshire 5000 index. The S & P focuses on 500 large, well-known compa-\nnies that make up roughly 70% of the total value of the U.S. equity market.\nThe Wilshire 5000 follows the returns of nearly every significant, publicly\nwww.fx1618.com28 The Intelligent Investor\nthe major point here is that the defensive investor’s overall results\nare not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep-\nresentative list than from another, or—more accurately—that nei-\nther he nor his advisers could predict with certainty whatever\ndifferences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of skill-\nful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the\nselection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-\nket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the\nability of defensive investors generally to get better than average\nresults—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-\nformance.* (Our skepticism extends to the management of large\nfunds by experts.)\nLet us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem\nto prove the opposite. Between December 1960 and December 1970\nthe DJIAadvanced from 616 to 839, or 36%. But in the same period\nthe much larger Standard & Poor’s weighted index of 500 stocks\nrose from 58.11 to 92.15, or 58%. Obviously the second group had\nproved a better “buy” than the first. But who would have been so\nrash as to predict in 1960 that what seemed like a miscellaneous\nassortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper-\nform the aristocratic “thirty tyrants” of the Dow? All this proves,\nwe insist, that only rarely can one make dependable predictions\nabout price changes, absolute or relative.\nWe shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot\nbe given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than\naverage results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any\nsort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.† The\ncontrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive\ninvestor must confine himself to the shares of important companies\nwith a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial\ncondition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such\ntraded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-\nnies account for most of the total value of the index, the return of the\nWilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500. Several low-\ncost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a\nsingle, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)\n*See pp. 363–366 and pp. 376–380.\n†For grewatewr dwet.afilx, s1e6e C1h8ap.cteor 6m.Investment versus Speculation 29\na list.) Aggressive investors may buy other types of common\nstocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-\nlished by intelligent analysis.\nToconclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-\ntary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the\npurchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an\nalternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might\nalso utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled\nfunds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,\nif his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-\nment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration\nof his investment program along standard lines. The third is the\ndevice of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the\npractitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars\neach month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when\nthe market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up\nwith a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-\ning, this method is an application of a broader approach known as\n“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-\ngestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks\nbetween the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-\ntionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the\ndefensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later\nchapters.*\nResults to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor\nOur enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and\nexpect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive\ncompanion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be\nworse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,\nand native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead\nof profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,\nbecome indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential\nthat the enterprising investor start with a clear conception as to\n*For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see Chapter 9.\n“Professional administration” by “a recognized investment-counsel firm” is\ndiscuwsswedw in .Cfxha1p6ter1 180.. c“Doomllar-cost averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.30 The Intelligent Investor\nwhich courses of action offer reasonable chances of success and\nwhich do not.\nFirst let us consider several ways in which investors and specu-\nlators generally have endeavored to obtain better than average\nresults. These include:\n1. Trading in the market. This usually means buying stocks\nwhen the market has been advancing and selling them after it has\nturned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those\nwhich have been “behaving” better than the market average. A\nsmall number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.\nHere they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the\nestablished mechanism of the stock exchanges. Their object is to\nbenefit from a subsequent decline in the price of these issues, by\nbuying them back at a price lower than they sold them for. (As our\nquotation from the Wall Street Journal on p. 19 indicates, even\n“small investors”—perish the term!—sometimes try their unskilled\nhand at short selling.)\n2.Short-term selectivity.This means buying stocks of compa-\nnies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings,\nor for which some other favorable development is anticipated.\n3. Long-term selectivity. Here the usual emphasis is on an\nexcellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-\ntinue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose\ncompanies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are\nexpected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies\nbelong frequently in some technological area—e.g., computers,\ndrugs, electronics—and they often are developing new processes\nor products that are deemed to be especially promising.)\nWehave already expressed a negative view about the investor’s\noverall chances of success in these areas of activity. The first we\nhave ruled out, on both theoretical and realistic grounds, from the\ndomain of investment. Stock trading is not an operation “which, on\nthorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory\nreturn.” More will be said on stock trading in a later chapter.*\n*See Chwapwterw 8..fx1618.comInvestment versus Speculation 31\nIn his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the\nnear term or the longer future, the investor faces obstacles of two\nkinds—the first stemming from human fallibility and the second\nfrom the nature of his competition. He may be wrong in his esti-\nmate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price\nmay already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of\nnear-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are\ngenerally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to\nthe extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-\nered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of\nthis year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for\nnext year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for\nthe same reason.\nIn choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor’s\nhandicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error\nin the prediction—which we illustrated by our airlines example on\np. 6—is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-\nings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is\ntheoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making\ncorrect predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect\nones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors\ncould count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-\nfessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term\nfuture earnings?\nWeare thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-\nsion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average\nresults, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently\nsound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.\nAre there any such policies available for the enterprising\ninvestor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there\nare broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in\npractice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-\nments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-\neral market and at all times in at least some of the individual\nissues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because\nof lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-\nther and assert that in an astonishingly large proportion of the\ntrading in common stocks, those engaged therein don’t appear to\nknow—in polite terms—one part of their anatomy from another. In\nthis wbowokw w.fex 1sh6al1l 8p.ocinot mout numerous examples of (past) dis-32 The Intelligent Investor\ncrepancies between price and value. Thus it seems that any intelli-\ngent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable\npicnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness. So it\nseems, but somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neg-\nlected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves\na protracted and patience-trying experience. And selling short a\ntoo popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not\nonly of one’s courage and stamina but also of the depth of one’s\npocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is\nnot impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.\nThere is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which\nover many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return\nof 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew\ntheir way around in this field. They include intersecurity arbi-\ntrages, payouts or workouts in liquidations, protected hedges of\ncertain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-\nsition which offers a substantially higher value for certain shares\nthan their price on the date of the announcement. The number of\nsuch deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have\nbeen a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti. But with the\nmultiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of\nobstacles to mergers and of deals that didn’t go through; quite a\nfew individual losses were thus realized in these once-reliable\noperations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished\nby too much competition.†\n*In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that its share\nprice will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-\nrow shares from someone who owns them; then you immediately sell the\nborrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the\nstock drops, you will be able to buy your replacement shares at a lower\nprice. The difference between the price at which you sold your borrowed\nshares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit\n(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs). How-\never, if the stock goes up in price instead of down, your potential loss is\nunlimited—making short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual\ninvestors.\n†In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts\nmultipliedw, Wwawll S.ftrxee1t 6se1t 8up. cinostmitutional arbitrage desks to profit from anyInvestment versus Speculation 33\nThe lessened profitability of these special situations appears one\nmanifestation of a kind of self-destructive process—akin to the law\nof diminishing returns—which has developed during the lifetime\nof this book. In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-\ntuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula—\nbased on earnings and current interest rates—for determining a\nlevel to buy the DJIA below its “central” or “intrinsic” value,\nand to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-\nerning maxim of the Rothschilds: “Buy cheap and sell dear.”* And\nit had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained\nand pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought\nbecause they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.\nAlas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. Asecond illustra-\ntion is provided by the famous “Dow Theory” of stock-market\nmovements, in a comparison of its indicated splendid results for\n1897–1933 and its much more questionable performance since\n1934.\nA third and final example of the golden opportunities not\nrecently available: A good part of our own operations on Wall\nStreet had been concentrated on the purchase of bargain issueseas-\nily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than\ntheir share in the net current assets (working capital) alone, not\ncounting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all\nliabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling\nat a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-\nness. No proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what\nhe owned at so ridiculously low a figure. Strangely enough, such\nerrors in pricing these complex deals. They became so good at it that the\neasy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down.\nAlthough Graham does discuss it again (see pp. 174–175), this sort of trad-\ning is no longer feasible or appropriate for most people, since only multi-\nmillion-dollar trades are large enough to generate worthwhile profits.\nWealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge\nfunds that specialize in merger or “event” arbitrage.\n*The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the dominant\npower in European investment banking and brokerage in the nineteenth\ncentury.

In 1957 a list was published show-\ning nearly 200 issues of this type available in the market. In various\nways practically all these bargain issues turned out to be profitable,\nand the average annual result proved much more remunerative\nthan most other investments. But they too virtually disappeared\nfrom the stock market in the next decade, and with them a depend-\nable area for shrewd and successful operation by the enterprising\ninvestor. However, at the low prices of 1970 there again appeared a\nconsiderable number of such “sub-working-capital” issues, and\ndespite the strong recovery of the market, enough of them\nremained at the end of the year to make up a full-sized portfolio.\nThe enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has vari-\nous possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge\nlist of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be\nidentified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable\nstandards. These should yield more satisfactory results on the\naverage than will the DJIAor any similarly representative list. In\nour view the search for these would not be worth the investor’s\neffort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the aver-\nage annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio. We shall\ntry to develop one or more such approaches to stock selection for\nuse by the active investor.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 1\nAll of human unhappiness comes from one single thing: not\nknowing how to remain at rest in a room.\n—Blaise Pascal\nW\nhydo you suppose the brokers on the floor of the New York Stock\nExchange always cheer at the sound of the closing bell—no matter\nwhat the market did that day? Because whenever you trade, they\nmake money—whether you did or not. By speculating instead of invest-\ning, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone\nelse’s.\nGraham’s definition of investing could not be clearer: “An invest-\nment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety\nof principal and an adequate return.”1Note that investing, according to\nGraham, consists equally of three elements:\n• you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its\nunderlying businesses, before you buy its stock;\n• you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;\n• you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.\n1Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his defini-\ntion: “thorough analysis” means “the study of the facts in the light of estab-\nlished standards of safety and value” while “safety of principal” signifies\n“protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or\nvariations” and “adequate” (or “satisfactory”) return refers to “any rate or\namount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, pro-\nvided he acts with reasonable intelligence.” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed.,\npp. 55–56).\nwww.fx1618.com\n3536 Commentary on Chapter 1\nAn investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of\nits businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price\nbecause somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once\nput it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of\nvalue,” while speculators “base [their] standards of value upon the\nmarket price.”2For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes\nis like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham\ncalled “quotational” values matter much less. Graham urges you to\ninvest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had\nno way of knowing its daily share price.3\nLike casino gambling or betting on the horses, speculating in the\nmarket can be exciting or even rewarding (if you happen to get lucky).\nBut it’s the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That’s because\nWall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds\nso that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who\ntries to beat the house at its own speculative game.\nOn the other hand, investingis a unique kind of casino—one where\nyou cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that\nput the odds squarely in your favor. People who investmake money for\nthemselves; people who speculatemake money for their brokers. And\nthat, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable\nvirtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.\nUNSAFE AT HIGH SPEED\nConfusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a\nmistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction. Almost\neveryone, it seems, ran out of patience at once, and America became\nthe Speculation Nation, populated with traders who went shooting\nfrom stock to stock like grasshoppers whizzing around in an August\nhay field.\nPeople began believing that the test of an investment technique\nwas simply whether it “worked.” If they beat the market over any\n2Security Analysis,1934 ed., p. 310.\n3As Graham advised in an interview, “Ask yourself: If there was no market\nfor these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on\nthese terms?” (Forbes,January 1, 1972, p. 90.)\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 1 37\nperiod, no matter how dangerous or dumb their tactics, people\nboasted that they were “right.” But the intelligent investor has no inter-\nest in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals,\nyou must be sustainably and reliably right. The techniques that\nbecame so trendy in the 1990s—day trading, ignoring diversification,\nflipping hot mutual funds, following stock-picking “systems”—seemed\nto work. But they had no chance of prevailing in the long run, because\nthey failed to meet all three of Graham’s criteria for investing.\nTo see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine\nthat two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed\nlimit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I\ncan get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”? Should\nyou be tempted to try it, too, because you hear me bragging that it\n“worked”? Flashy gimmicks for beating the market are much the\nsame: In short streaks, so long as your luck holds out, they work. Over\ntime, they will get you killed.\nIn 1973, when Graham last revised The Intelligent Investor, the\nannual turnover rate on the New York Stock Exchange was 20%,\nmeaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before\nselling it. By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%—a holding period of\nonly 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a\nstock for nearly three years; by 2002, that ownership period had\nshrunk to just 10.9 months. It’s as if mutual-fund managers were\nstudying their stocks just long enough to learn they shouldn’t have\nbought them in the first place, then promptly dumping them and start-\ning all over.\nEven the most respected money-management firms got antsy. In\nearly 1995, Jeffrey Vinik, manager of Fidelity Magellan (then the\nworld’s largest mutual fund), had 42.5% of its assets in technology\nstocks. Vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders “have invested\nin the fund for goals that are years away....I think their objectives are\nthe same as mine, and that they believe, as I do, that a long-term\napproach is best.” But six months after he wrote those high-minded\nwords, Vinik sold off almost all his technology shares, unloading nearly\n$19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks.

Online trading would take no work\nand require no thought.

Throughout the past decade or so, one speculative for-\nmula after another was promoted, popularized, and then thrown aside.\nAll of them shared a few traits—This is quick! This is easy! And it won’t\nhurt a bit!—and all of them violated at least one of Graham’s distinc-\ntions between investing and speculating. Here are a few of the trendy\nformulas that fell flat:\n• Cash in on the calendar. The “January effect”—the tendency of\nsmall stocks to produce big gains around the turn of the year—\nwas widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub-\nlished in the 1980s. These studies showed that if you piled into\nsmall stocks in the second half of December and held them into\nJanuary, you would beat the market by five to 10 percentage\npoints. That amazed many experts. After all, if it were this easy,\nsurely everyone would hear about it, lots of people would do it,\nand the opportunity would wither away.\nWhat caused the January jolt? First of all, many investors sell\ntheir crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can\ncut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow\nmore cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve\ntheir outperformance (or minimize their underperformance). That\nmakes them reluctant to buy (or even hang on to) a falling stock.\nAnd if an underperforming stock is also small and obscure, a\nmoney manager will be even less eager to show it in his year-end\n9In 2000 and 2001, Amazon.com and Qualcomm lost a cumulative total of\n85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.\nwww.fx1618.com42 Commentary on Chapter 1\nlist of holdings. All these factors turn small stocks into momentary\nbargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-\ncally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.\nThe January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.\nAccording to finance professor William Schwert of the University of\nRochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and\nsold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5\npercentage points from 1962 through 1979, by 4.4 points from\n1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.10\nAs more people learned about the January effect, more traders\nbought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain\nand thus reducing their returns. Also, the January effect is biggest\namong the smallest stocks—but according to Plexus Group, the\nleading authority on brokerage expenses, the total cost of buying\nand selling such tiny stocks can run up to 8% of your invest-\nment.11Sadly, by the time you’re done paying your broker, all your\ngains on the January effect will melt away.\n• Just do “what works.” In 1996, an obscure money manager\nnamed James O’Shaughnessy published a book called What\nWorks on Wall Street. In it, he argued that “investors can do\nmuch better than the market.” O’Shaughnessy made a stunning\nclaim: From 1954 through 1994, you could have turned $10,000\ninto $8,074,504, beating the market by more than 10-fold—a tow-\nering 18.2% average annual return. How? By buying a basket of\n50stocks with the highest one-year returns, five straight years of\nrising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5 times their corpo-\nrate revenues.12 As if he were the Edison of Wall Street,\nO’Shaughnessy obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,978,778 for his “auto-\nmated strategies” and launched a group of four mutual funds\nbased on his findings. By late 1999 the funds had sucked in more\nthan $175 million from the public—and, in his annual letter to\nshareholders, O’Shaughnessy stated grandly: “As always, I hope\n10Schwert discusses these findings in a brilliant research paper, “Anomalies and\nMarket Efficiency,” available at http://schwert.ssb.rochester.edu/papers.htm.\n11See Plexus Group Commentary 54, “The Official Icebergs of Transaction\nCosts,” January, 1998, at www.plexusgroup.com/fs_research.html.\n12James O’Shaughnessy, What Works on Wall Street(McGraw-Hill, 1996),\npp. xvi, 2w73w–2w95..fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 1 43\nWhat Used to Work on Wall Street . . .\n$250\n$200\n$150\n$100\n$50\n$0\nN\nov- 9 6\nF e\nb- 9\nM\n7 ay- 9 7\nA u\ng- 9\nN\n7 ov- 9 7\nF e\nb- 9\nM\n8 ay- 9 8\nA u\ng- 9\nN\n8 ov- 9 8\nF e\nb- 9\nM\n9 ay- 9 9\nA u\ng- 9\nN\n9 ov- 9 9\nF e\nb- 0\nM\n0 ay- 0 0\nA u\ng- 0 0\n6991\n,1\nrebmevoN\nno\ndetsevni\n001$\nfo\neulaV\nthat together, we can reach our long-term goals by staying the\ncourse and sticking with our time-tested investment strategies.”\nBut “what works on Wall Street” stopped working right after\nO’Shaughnessy publicized it.

Best of all, this tech-\nnique had “minimal risk.” All you needed to do was this:\n1. Take the five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average with\nthe lowest stock prices and highest dividend yields.\n2. Discard the one with the lowest price.\n3. Put 40% of your money in the stock with the second-lowest\nprice.\n4. Put 20% in each of the three remaining stocks.\n5. One year later, sort the Dow the same way and reset the\nportfolio according to steps 1 through 4.\n6. Repeat until wealthy.\nOver a 25-year period, the Motley Fool claimed, this technique\nwould have beaten the market by a remarkable 10.1 percentage\n13In a remarkable irony, the surviving two O’Shaughnessy funds (now\nknown as the Hennessy funds) began performing quite well just as\nO’Shaughnessy announced that he was turning over the management to\nanother company. The funds’ shareholders were furious. In a chat room at\nwww.morningstar.com, one fumed: “I guess ‘long term’ for O’S is 3 years.\n...I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O’S’s method....I had told several\nfriends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they didn’t act on my\nadvice.” www.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 1 45\npoints annually. Over the next two decades, they suggested,\n$20,000 invested in The Foolish Four should flower into\n$1,791,000. (And, they claimed, you could do still better by pick-\ning the five Dow stocks with the highest ratio of dividend yield to\nthe square root of stock price, dropping the one that scored the\nhighest, and buying the next four.)\nLet’s consider whether this “strategy” could meet Graham’s\ndefinitions of an investment:\n• What kind of “thorough analysis” could justify discarding the\nstock with the single most attractive price and dividend—but\nkeeping the four that score lower for those desirable qualities?\n• How could putting 40% of your money into only one stock be a\n“minimal risk”?\n• And how could a portfolio of only four stocks be diversified\nenough to provide “safety of principal”?\nThe Foolish Four, in short, was one of the most cockamamie\nstock-picking formulas ever concocted. The Fools made the same\nmistake as O’Shaughnessy: If you look at a large quantity of data\nlong enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge—if only by\nchance. By random luck alone, the companies that produce\nabove-average stock returns will have plenty of things in common.\nBut unless those factors cause the stocks to outperform, they\ncan’t be used to predict future returns.\nNone of the factors that the Motley Fools “discovered” with\nsuch fanfare—dropping the stock with the best score, doubling up\non the one with the second-highest score, dividing the dividend\nyield by the square root of stock price—could possibly cause or\nexplain the future performance of a stock. MoneyMagazine found\nthat a portfolio made up of stocks whose names contained no\nrepeating letters would have performed nearly as well as The\nFoolish Four—and for the same reason: luck alone.14 As Graham\nnever stops reminding us, stocks do well or poorly in the future\nbecause the businesses behind them do well or poorly—nothing\nmore, and nothing less.\n14See Jason Zweig, “False Profits,” Money, August, 1999, pp. 55–57. A\nthorough discussion of The Foolish Four can also be found at www.investor\nhomew.cowmw/fo.oflx.ht1m6. 18.com46 Commentary on Chapter 1\nSure enough, instead of crushing the market, The Foolish Four\ncrushed the thousands of people who were fooled into believing\nthat it was a form of investing. In 2000 alone, the four Foolish\nstocks—Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, SBC, and General Motors—\nlost 14% while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%.\nAs these examples show, there’s only one thing that never suffers a\nbear market on Wall Street: dopey ideas. Each of these so-called\ninvesting approaches fell prey to Graham’s Law. All mechanical formu-\nlas for earning higher stock performance are “a kind of self-destructive\nprocess—akin to the law of diminishing returns.” There are two reasons\nthe returns fade away. If the formula was just based on random statis-\ntical flukes (like The Foolish Four), the mere passage of time will\nexpose that it made no sense in the first place. On the other hand, if\nthe formula actually did work in the past (like the January effect), then\nby publicizing it, market pundits always erode—and usually eliminate—\nits ability to do so in the future.\nAll this reinforces Graham’s warning that you must treat specula-\ntion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:\n• You must never delude yourself into thinking that you’re investing\nwhen you’re speculating.\n• Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin\nto take it seriously.\n• You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.\nJust as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor\nand leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room,\nthe intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as\na “mad money” account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is\nthe maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Nevermin-\ngle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your invest-\nment accounts; neverallow your speculative thinking to spill over into\nyour investing activities; and neverput more than 10% of your assets\ninto your mad money account, no matter what happens.\nFor better or worse, the gambling instinct is part of human nature—\nso it’s futile for most people even to try suppressing it. But you must\nconfine and restrain it. That’s the single best way to make sure you will\nnever fool yourself into confusing speculation with investment.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 2\nThe Investor and Inflation\nI\nnflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the\npublic’s mind in recent years. The shrinkage in the purchasing\npower of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope\nby speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has\ngreatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those\nwith a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living\nadvances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-\npal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a\nloss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in\ntheir dividends and the prices of their shares.\nOn the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities\nhave concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form\nof investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by their\nvery nature more desirable investments than bonds. We have\nheard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios\nshould consist 100% of stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is\nquite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were\n*By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a foundation\nor endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had spread to indi-\nvidual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994 edition of his influ-\nential book, Stocks for the Long Run,finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the\nWharton School recommended that “risk-taking” investors should buy on\nmargin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their\nassets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February\n1999, the Honorable Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the\naudience at an investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for any-\none to have any money in a bond fund.”\nwww.fx1618.com\n4748 The Intelligent Investor\nrestricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice preferred\nstocks).\nOur readers must have enough intelligence to recognize that\neven high-quality stocks cannot be a better purchase than bonds\nunder all conditions—i.e., regardless of how high the stock market\nmay be and how low the current dividend return compared with\nthe rates available on bonds. Astatement of this kind would be as\nabsurd as was the contrary one—too often heard years ago—that\nany bond is safer than any stock. In this chapter we shall try to\napply various measurements to the inflation factor, in order to\nreach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may\nwisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the\nprice level.\nIn this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our\nviews of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-\ntion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it\nhas taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-\ntions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them\nin confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a\ncondensed historical tabulation that contains much information\nabout changes in the general price level and concomitant changes\nin the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures\nwill begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-\nyear intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of\nwartime price controls.)\nThe first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the\npast—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and\n1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with\nthe advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have\nhad three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at\nvarying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor\nshould clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent\ninflation to come.\nCan we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear\nanswer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It\nwould seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-\nsistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the\nconsumer price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for\n1965–1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%.

(This would compare with an annual rate of\nabout 21⁄% for the entire period 1915–1970.)1\n2\nWhat would be the implications of such an advance? It would\neat up, in higher living costs, about one-half the income now\nobtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed\nafter-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would\nbe a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would\nnot mean that the true value, or the purchasing power, of the\ninvestor’s fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half\nhis interest income after taxes he would maintain this buying\npower intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.\nBut the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reason-\nably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than\nhigh-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered\nin 1970–1971?” Would not, for example, an all-stock program be\npreferable to a part-bond, part-stock program? Do not common\nstocks have a built-in protection against inflation, and are they not\nalmost certain to give a better return over the years than will\nbonds? Have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than\nhave bonds over the 55-year period of our study?\nThe answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Com-\nmon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period\nof time in the past. The rise of the DJIAfrom an average of 77 in\n1915 to an average of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual com-\npounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%\nfor average dividend return. (The corresponding figures for the\nS & Pcomposite are about the same.) These combined figures of 8%\n*This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two years after\nPresident Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls, inflation hit\n8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The decade from 1973\nthrough 1982 was the most inflationary in modern American history, as the\ncost of living more than doubled.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Inflation 51\nper year are of course much better than the return enjoyed from\nbonds over the same 55-year period. But they do not exceed that\nnowoffered by high-grade bonds. This brings us to the next logical\nquestion: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common\nstocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in\nthe last five and one-half decades?\nOur answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common\nstocksmaydo better in the future than in the past, but they are far\nfrom certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time\nelements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to\noccur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second\napplies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially\nand psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five\nyears or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his\nsatisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-\nsions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of\na lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year\nto year.\nOn this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-\nnection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the\nmovement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious\nexample is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-\ning was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But\nboth stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since\n1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the\nrecord of previous five-year periods.\nInflation and Corporate Earnings\nAnother and highly important approach to the subject is by a\nstudy of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.\nThis has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic\nactivity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with\nwholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen\nrather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of\nthe period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of\nmore liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-\nies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on\nmuch above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIAgroup—\nwww.fx1618.com52 The Intelligent Investor\nabout 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares.2\nSince the market value of these issues is well above their book\nvalue—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on\ncurrent market price work out only at some 61⁄%. (This relation-\n4\nship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,”\nmanner—e.g., that the DJIAprice of 900 equals 18 times the actual\nearnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)\nOur figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous\nchapter* that the investor may assume an average dividend return\nof about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-\ntion of, say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note\nthat each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase\nthe market price by about $1.60.)\nThe reader will object that in the end our calculations make no\nallowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to\nresult from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is\nthe absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount\nin the past has had any directeffect on reported per-share earnings.\nThe cold figures demonstrate that allthe large gain in the earnings\nof the DJIAunit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately\nlarge growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If\ninflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect\nwould have been to increase the “value” of previously existing\ncapital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old\ncapital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. But\nnothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during\nwhich the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40%. (Busi-\nness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than\nby “consumer prices.”) The only way that inflation can add to\ncommon stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on cap-\nital investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been\nthe case.\nIn the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-\nnied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It\nwas generally felt that “a little inflation” was helpful to business\nprofits. This view is not contradicted by the history of 1950–1970,\n*See p. 25.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Inflation 53\nwhich reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and\ngenerally rising prices. But the figures indicate that the effect of all\nthis on the earning powerof common-stock capital (“equity capital”)\nhas been quite limited; in fact it has not even served to maintain the\nrate of earnings on the investment. Clearly there have been impor-\ntant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the\nreal profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the\nmost important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceed-\ning the gains in productivity, and (2) the need for huge amounts\nof new capital, thus holding down the ratio of sales to capital\nemployed.\nOur figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having\nbenefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has\nbeen quite the opposite. The most striking figures in our table are\nthose for the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969. It is\nsurprising how little attention has been paid by economists and by\nWall Street to this development. The debt of corporations has\nexpanded nearly fivefold while their profits before taxes a little\nmore than doubled. With the great rise in interest rates during this\nperiod, it is evident that the aggregate corporate debt is now an\nTABLE 2-2 Corporate Debt, Profits, and Earnings on Capital,\n1950–1969\nCorporate Profits\nNet Corporate Before After Percent Earned on Capital\nDebt Income Tax Tax S & P Other\nYear (billions) (millions) (millions) Dataa Datab\n1950 $140.2 $42.6 $17 8 18.3% 15.0%\n1955 212.1 48.6 27.0 18.3% 12.9%\n1960 302.8 49.7 26.7 10.4% 9.1%\n1965 453.3 77.8 46.5 10.8% 11.8%\n1969 692.9 91.2 48.5 11.8% 11.3%\naEarnings of Standard & Poor’s industrial index divided by average book value for\nyear.\nbFigures for 1950 and 1955 from Cottle and Whitman; those for 1960–1969 from\nFortune.\nwww.fx1618.com54 The Intelligent Investor\nadverse economic factor of some magnitude and a real problem for\nmany individual enterprises. (Note that in 1950 net earnings after\ninterest but before income tax were about 30% of corporate debt,\nwhile in 1969 they were only 13.2% of debt. The 1970 ratio must\nhave been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a signifi-\ncant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a whole\nis accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing\n4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the\ndebt ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have\nfallen still lower, in spite of the inflation.\nThe stock market has considered that the public-utility enter-\nprises have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a\ngreat advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of\nraising the rates charged under the regulatory process. But this\nmay be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of\nelectricity, gas, and telephone services have advanced so much less\nthan the general price index puts these companies in a strong\nstrategic position for the future.3They are entitled by law to charge\nrates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital, and\nthis will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has\nin the inflations of the past.\nAll of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the\ninvestor has no sound basis for expecting more than an average\noverall return of, say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common\nstocks purchased at the late 1971 price level. But even if these\nexpectations should prove to be understated by a substantial\namount, the case would not be made for an all-stock investment\nprogram. If there is one thing guaranteed for the future, it is that\nthe earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio\nwillnotgrow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other figure. In the\nmemorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, “They will fluctuate.”*\nThis means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s prices—\n*John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late nine-\nteenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence, he was\nconstantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan developed a\nmercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will fluctuate.” See Jean\nStrouse,Morgan: American Financier(Random House, 1999), p. 11.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Inflation 55\nor tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory\nresults therefrom over a period of years. It took 25 years for Gen-\neral Electric (and the DJIAitself) to recover the ground lost in the\n1929–1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor concentrates his\nportfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either\nby exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This is particu-\nlarly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur-\nther inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he will\ntake the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as a\nchance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a vindica-\ntion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying\ncommon stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low\nthe dividend return. That way lies sorrow.\nAlternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges\nThe standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust\ntheir currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against\nthe law for American citizens since 1935—luckily for them. In the\npast 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced\nfrom $35 per ounce to $48 in early 1972—a rise of only 35%. But\nduring all this time the holder of gold has received no income\nreturn on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual\nexpense for storage. Obviously, he would have done much better\nwith his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in\nthe general price level.\nThe near-complete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the\npurchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the abil-\nity of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by\nputting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable\n*The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham was\n“dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at least in the\nyears after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust ability to out-\npace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein agrees, pointing out that a\ntiny allocation to a precious-metals fund (say, 2% of your total assets) is too\nsmall to hurt your overall returns when gold does poorly. But, when gold\ndoes well, its returns are often so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100%\nwww.fx1618.com56 The Intelligent Investor\nobjects have had striking advances in market value over the\nyears—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of\nbooks, rare stamps and coins, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of\nthese cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the pre-\ncarious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is\nhard to think of paying $67,500 for a U.S. silver dollar dated 1804\n(but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.”4We\nacknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our\nreaders will find the swimming safe and easy there.\nThe outright ownership of real estate has long been considered\nas a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount\nof protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are\nalso subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in\nlocation, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles.\nFinally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate\nmeans, except by various types of participations with others and\nwith the special hazards that attach to new flotations—not too dif-\nferent from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All\nwe should say to the investor is, “Be sure it’s yours before you go\ninto it.”\nConclusion\nNaturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous\nchapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor\ncannot afford to put all his funds into one basket—neither in the\nbond basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds\nhave recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect\nof continuing inflation.\nThe more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income\ntherefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the\nin a year—that it can, all by itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter-\ning. However, the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its\nhigh storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual\nfund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging\nbelow 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total financial\nassets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Inflation 57\nunexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life. It is\naxiomatic that the conservative investor should seek to minimize\nhis risks. We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a\ntelephone-company bond at yields of nearly 71⁄% are much less\n2\nthan those involved in buying the DJIA at 900 (or any stock list\nequivalent thereto). But the possibility of large-scale inflation\nremains, and the investor must carry some insurance against it.\nThere is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately\nagainst such inflation, but it should carry more protection than the\nbond component.\nThis is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition (p. 97),\nand we would write the same today:\nIt must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for\ncommon stocks at these levels (892 for the DJIA). For reasons\nalready given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to\nbe without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his\nportfolio, even if we regard them as the lesser of two evils—the\ngreater being the risks in an all-bond holding.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 2\nAmericans are getting stronger. Twenty years ago, it took two\npeople to carry ten dollars’ worth of groceries. Today, a five-\nyear-old can do it.\n—Henny Youngman\nI\nnflation? Who cares about that?\nAfter all, the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged\nless than 2.2% between 1997 and 2002—and economists believe\nthat even that rock-bottom rate may be overstated.1 (Think, for\ninstance, of how the prices of computers and home electronics have\nplummeted—and how the quality of many goods has risen, meaning\nthat consumers are getting better value for their money.) In recent\nyears, the true rate of inflation in the United States has probably run\naround 1% annually—an increase so infinitesimal that many pundits\nhave proclaimed that “inflation is dead.”2\n1The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the Consumer Price\nIndex that measures inflation, maintains a comprehensive and helpful web-\nsite at www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.\n2For a lively discussion of the “inflation is dead” scenario, see www.pbs.\norg/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html. In 1996, the\nBoskin Commission, a group of economists asked by the government to\ninvestigate whether the official rate of inflation is accurate, estimated that it\nhas been overstated, often by nearly two percentage points per year. For the\ncommission’s report, see www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html. Many\ninvestment experts now feel that deflation, or falling prices, is an even\ngreater threat than inflation; the best way to hedge against that risk is by\nincluding bonds as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the com-\nmentary on Chapter 4.)\nwww.fx1618.com\n58Commentary on Chapter 2 59\nTHE MONEY ILLUSION\nThere’s another reason investors overlook the importance of inflation:\nwhat psychologists call the “money illusion.” If you receive a 2% raise\nin a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost certainly feel better\nthan you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a year when inflation is\nzero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical\nposition—2% worse off after inflation. So long as the nominal (or\nabsolute) change is positive, we view it as a good thing—even if the\nreal (or after-inflation) result is negative. And any change in your own\nsalary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices\nin the economy as a whole.3Likewise, investors were delighted to earn\n11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly\ndisappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003—even though\nthey were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up\nwith inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank’s\nads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel\ngood. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of\ntaking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation\nis so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your\ninvesting success not just by what you make, but by how much you\nkeep after inflation.\nMore basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard\nagainst whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three\ngood reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:\n• As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one\nof the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured\nby the Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over\nthat period, rising at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979\nalone, inflation raged at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what\nbecame known as “stagflation”—and leading many commentators\nto question whether America could compete in the global market-\n3For more insights into this behavioral pitfall, see Eldar Shafir, Peter Dia-\nmond, and Amos Tversky, “Money Illusion,” in Daniel Kahneman and Amos\nTversky, eds., Choices, Values, and Frames (Cambridge University Press,\n2000), pp. 335–355.\nwww.fx1618.com60 Commentary on Chapter 2\nplace.4 Goods and services priced at $100 in the beginning of\n1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dol-\nlar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff\nat such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to\nprotect against the risk that it might recur.\n• Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have\nsuffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized\nrate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods\ndestroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power.5Wewould be\ncrazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a\ndisaster. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it can\nnever happen here.6\n• Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars\nthat have been cheapened by inflation. Completely eradicating\ninflation runs against the economic self-interest of any govern-\nment that regularly borrows money.7\n4That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous “malaise” speech, in\nwhich he warned of “a crisis in confidence” that “strikes at the very heart\nand soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to destroy the social\nand the political fabric of America.”\n5See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, “Modern Hyper-\nand High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper\n8930, at www.nber.org/papers/w8930.\n6In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the\nAmerican Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through\n1779, with a pound of butter costing $12 and a barrel of flour fetching\nnearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-\ntion raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and nearly 200% (in the\nConfederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.\n7I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,\nbut accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or steadily falling\nprices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower—which is why\nmost investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds,\nas a form of insurance against deflating prices.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 2 61\nHALF A HEDGE\nWhat, then, can the intelligent investor do to guard against inflation?\nThe standard answer is “buy stocks”—but, as common answers so\noften are, it is not entirely true.\nFigure 2-1 shows, for each year from 1926 through 2002, the rela-\ntionship between inflation and stock prices.\nAs you can see, in years when the prices of consumer goods and\nservices fell, as on the left side of the graph, stock returns were terri-\nble—with the market losing up to 43% of its value.8When inflation shot\nabove 6%, as in the years on the right end of the graph, stocks also\nstank. The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which\ninflation exceeded 6%; the average return for those 14 years was a\nmeasly 2.6%.\nWhile mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs\nof their own raw materials on to customers, high inflation wreaks\nhavoc—forcing customers to slash their purchases and depressing\nactivity throughout the economy.\nThe historical evidence is clear: Since the advent of accurate\nstock-market data in 1926, there have been 64 five-year periods\n(i.e., 1926–1930, 1927–1931, 1928–1932, and so on through\n1998–2002). In 50 of those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time),\nstocks outpaced inflation.9 That’s impressive, but imperfect; it means\nthat stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.\n8When inflation is negative, it is technically termed “deflation.” Regularly\nfalling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think of the Japanese\nexample. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989, with real estate\nand the stock market dropping in value year after year—a relentless water\ntorture for the world’s second-largest economy.\n9Ibbotson Associates, Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation, 2003 Handbook\n(Ibbotson Associates, Chicago, 2003), Table 2-8.

Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters\nhave become widely available to investors:\nREITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced\n“reets”), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial\nand residential properties.10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds,\nREITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van-\nguard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include\nCohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund,\nand Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.11 While a REIT fund is\nunlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give\nyou some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without\nhampering your overall returns.\nTIPS. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S.\ngovernment bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in\nvalue when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the\nUnited States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from\nthe risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran-\ntee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In\none easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the\nloss of purchasing power.12\nThere is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond\nrises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that\nincrease in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper\n10Thorough, if sometimes outdated, information on REITs can be found at\nwww.nareit.com.\n11For further information, see www.vanguard.com, www.cohenandsteers.\ncom, www.columbiafunds.com, and www.fidelity.com. The case for investing\nin a REIT fund is weaker if you own a home, since that gives you an inherent\nstake in real-estate ownership.\n12A good introduction to TIPS can be found at www.publicdebt.treas.gov/\nof/ofinflin.htm. For more advanced discussions, see www.federalreserve.\ngov/Pubs/feds/2002/200232/200232pap.pdf, www.tiaa-crefinstitute.org/\nPublications/resdiags/73_09-2002.htm, and www.bwater.com/research_\nibonds.htm.\nwww.fx1618.com64 Commentary on Chapter 2\ngain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does\nthis make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the\nwise words of financial analyst Mark Schweber: “The one question\nnever to ask a bureaucrat is ‘Why?’” Because of this exasperating tax\ncomplication, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement\naccount like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your\ntaxable income.\nYou can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at www.\npublicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like\nVanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected\nBond Fund.13Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal sub-\nstitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise\nkeep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run,\nso they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors,\nallocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelli-\ngent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and entirely\nbeyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.\n13For details on these funds, see www.vanguard.com or www.fidelity.com.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 3\nA Century of Stock-Market History:\nThe Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972\nT\nhe investor’s portfolio of common stocks will represent a small\ncross-section of that immense and formidable institution known as\nthe stock market. Prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea\nof stock-market history, in terms particularly of the major fluctua-\ntions in its price level and of the varying relationships between\nstock prices as a whole and their earnings and dividends. With this\nbackground he may be in a position to form some worthwhile\njudgment of the attractiveness or dangers of the level of the market\nas it presents itself at different times. By a coincidence, useful sta-\ntistical data on prices, earnings, and dividends go back just 100\nyears, to 1871. (The material is not nearly as full or dependable in\nthe first half-period as in the second, but it will serve.) In this chap-\nter we shall present the figures, in highly condensed form, with\ntwo objects in view. The first is to show the general manner in\nwhich stocks have made their underlying advance through the\nmany cycles of the past century. The second is to view the picture\nin terms of successive ten-year averages, not only of stock prices\nbut of earnings and dividends as well, to bring out the varying\nrelationship between the three important factors. With this wealth\nof material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the\nlevel of stock prices at the beginning of 1972.\nThe long-term history of the stock market is summarized in two\ntables and a chart.

The sec-\nond is the even more celebrated Dow Jones Industrial Average (the\nDJIA, or “the Dow”), which dates back to 1897; it contains 30 com-\npanies, of which one is American Telephone & Telegraph and the\nother 29 are large industrial enterprises.1\nChart I, presented by courtesy of Standard & Poor’s, depicts the\nmarket fluctuations of its 425-industrial-stock index from 1900\nthrough 1970. (A corresponding chart available for the DJIA will\nlook very much the same.) The reader will note three quite distinct\npatterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs\nfrom 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather\nsimilar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual\nadvance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the\n“New Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible after-\nmath of collapse, followed by quite irregular fluctuations until\n1949. Comparing the average level of 1949 with that of 1924, we\nfind the annual rate of advance to be a mere 11⁄%; hence the close of\n2\nour second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for\ncommon stocks. By the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the\nbeginning of the greatest bull market in our history, presented in\nthe last third of our chart. This phenomenon may have reached its\nculmination in December 1968 at 118 for Standard & Poor’s 425\nindustrials (and 108 for its 500-stock composite). As Table 3-1\nshows, there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968\n(especially in 1956–57 and 1961–62), but the recoveries therefrom\nwere so rapid that they had to be denominated (in the long-\naccepted semantics) as recessions in a single bull market, rather\nthan as separate market cycles. Between the low level of 162 for\n“the Dow” in mid-1949 and the high of 995 in early 1966, the\nadvance had been more than sixfold in 17 years—which is at the\naverage compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends\nof, say, 31⁄% per annum. (The advance for the Standard & Poor’s\n2\ncomposite index was somewhat greater than that of the DJIA—\nactually from 14 to 96.)\nThese 14% and better returns were documented in 1963, and\nlater, in a much publicized study.*2It created a natural satisfaction\n*The study, in its final form, was Lawrence Fisher and James H.

Few people seem to have\nbeen bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might\nindicate that it had been overdone. The subsequent decline from the\n1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the Standard & Poor’s com-\nposite (and 37% for the DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in\n1939–1942, which had reflected the perils and uncertainties after\nPearl Harbor. In the dramatic manner so characteristic of Wall\nStreet, the low level of May 1970 was followed by a massive and\nspeedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of a new\nall-time high for the Standard & Poor’s industrials in early 1972.\nThe annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out\nat about 9% for the S & Pcomposite (or the industrial index), using\nthe average figures for both years. That rate of climb was, of course,\nmuch greater than for any similar period before 1950. (But in the last\ndecade the rate of advance was much lower—51⁄% for the S & P\n4\ncomposite index and only the once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)\nThe record of price movements should be supplemented by cor-\nresponding figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide\nan overall view of what has happened to our share economy over\nthe ten decades. We present a conspectus of this kind in our Table\n3-2 (p. 71). It is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study\nall these figures with care, but for some we hope they will be inter-\nesting and instructive.\nLet us comment on them as follows: The full decade figures\nsmooth out the year-to-year fluctuations and leave a general pic-\nture of persistent growth. Only two of the nine decades after the\nfirst show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 1891–1900\nand 1931–1940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver-\nage dividends. But the rates of growth in all three categories are\nquite variable. In general the performance since World War II has\nbeen superior to that of earlier decades, but the advance in the\n1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s. Today’s investor\nRecord, 1926–65,” The Journal of Business, vol. XLI, no. 3 (July, 1968),\npp. 291–316. For a summary of the study’s wide influence, see http://\nlibrary.dfaus.com/reprints/work_of_art/.\nwww.fx1618.com70 The Intelligent Investor\ncannot tell from this record what percentage gain in earnings divi-\ndends and prices he may expect in the next ten years, but it does\nsupply all the encouragement he needs for a consistent policy of\ncommon-stock investment.\nHowever, a point should be made here that is not disclosed in\nour table. The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in\nthe overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit\non invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World\nWar years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number\nof companies reported net losses for the year; many became “finan-\ncially troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were\nquite a few important bankruptcy proceedings. These facts as\nmuch as any others have prompted the statement made above*\nthat the great boom era may have come to an end in 1969–1970.\nAstriking feature of Table 3-2 is the change in the price/earn-\nings ratios since World War II.† In June 1949 the S & P composite\nindex sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12\nmonths; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi-\ndend yield on the S & Pindex had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to\nonly 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest\nrates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to\n4.50%. This is certainly the most remarkable turnabout in the\npublic’s attitude in all stock-market history.\nTo people of long experience and innate caution the passage\nfrom one extreme to another carried a strong warning of trou-\nble ahead. They could not help thinking apprehensively of the\n1926–1929 bull market and its tragic aftermath. But these fears have\nnot been confirmed by the event. True, the closing price of the DJIA\n*See pp. 50–52.\n†The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like the S & P\n500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the market’s temperature. If, for\ninstance, a company earned $1 per share of net income over the past year,\nand its stock is selling at $8.93 per share, its price/earnings ratio would be\n8.93; if, however, the stock is selling at $69.70, then the price/earnings ratio\nwould be 69.7. In general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is\nconsidered low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater\nthan 20 is considered expensive.

But nothing has happened either\nto business or to stock prices that can compare with the bear mar-\nket and depression of 1929–1932.\nThe Stock-Market Level in Early 1972\nWith a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and\ndividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions\nabout the level of 900 for the DJIAand 100 for the S & Pcomposite\nindex in January 1972.\nIn each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the\nstock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the\nquestion whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The\nreader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached\non these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-\npunishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the\nvarious stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also\na taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries\nto reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-\nels. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959\nanalyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:\nIn 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones\nlevel of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that\n“it was not too high in relation to underlying values.” When we\napproached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that\nyear had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked\nourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the\nlevel of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high\nfor sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular\nadvance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no\nmeans easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-\ntiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that\n“from the standpoint of value indications—our chief investment\nguide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”\nBut we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages\nhad advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the\nwww.fx1618.comACentury of Stock-Market History 73\npast, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting these\nfactors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-\ntious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-\nularly brilliant counsel. Agood prophet would have foreseen that\nthe market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the\nnext five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if\nany of those whose business was stock-market forecasting—as\nours was not—had any better inkling than we did of what lay\nahead.\nAt the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIAat an all-time high\nof 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be\nsummarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):\n“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-\nent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous\nbecause prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the\ncase the market’s momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to\nunjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the\nfuture in which there will never be any serious losses, and in\nwhich, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock\npurchases.”\nThe caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-\nfied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet\nit was far from fully vindicated. The DJIAadvanced to 685 in 1961;\nthen fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;\nadvanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic\nto 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period\nof six months. At the same time there was a far more serious\nshrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by\nthe striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business\nMachines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in\nJune 1962.\nThis period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched\ncommon stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—\nwhich had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices\nand then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to\nlevels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the\nquotations in just a few months.\nThe collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not\ndisastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps\nwww.fx1618.com74 The Intelligent Investor\nto many more imprudent people who called themselves “in-\nvestors.” But the turnabout that came later that year was equally\nunsuspected by the financial community. The stock-market aver-\nages resumed their upward course, producing the following\nsequence:\nStandard & Poor’s\nDJIA 500-Stock Composite\nDecember 1961 735 72.64\nJune 1962 536 52.32\nNovember 1964 892 86.28\nThe recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was\nindeed remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall\nStreet sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had\nappeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to\nthe end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.\nBut at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms\nwas again manifest; nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish\nside, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.\nWe then approached the task of appraising the November 1964\nlevels of the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing\nit learnedly from numerous angles we reached three main con-\nclusions. The first was that “old standards (of valuation) appear\ninapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time.”\nThe second was that the investor “must base his policy on the\nexistence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the\nextremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in\nthe market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the\nother hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni-\ntude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450\"\n(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We\nsaid: “Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how\ncould we say that any price level is too high?” And the chapter\nclosed as follows:\nwww.fx1618.comACentury of Stock-Market History 75\nWHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW\nInvestors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan-\ngerous merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh\nour reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from\nmost competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end\neach one must make his own decision and accept responsibility\ntherefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to\nwhich course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The\nprinciples of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-\nlowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:\n1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.\n2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.\n3. Areduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring\nit down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The\ncapital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,\nand the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a\nsavings deposit.\nInvestors who for some time have been following a bona fide\ndollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their\nperiodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel\nthe market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather\nstrongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the\nlate 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina\nto pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should\nappear highly unfavorable.\nThis time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA\nadvanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a\nlow of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of\ndebacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines\nrunning as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.\nAnd, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture\nappeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and\ngreater doubts. Asingle fact may summarize the story: The DJIA\nclosed 1970 at a level lower than six years before—the first time\nsuch a thing had happened since 1944.\nwww.fx1618.com76 The Intelligent Investor\nSuch were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is\nthere anything we and our readers can learn from them? We con-\nsidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953\n(but too cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584\nfor DJIA), and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments\ncould be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-\nful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in\nfavor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the\none hand, and discouraging endeavors to “beat the market” or to\n“pick the winners” on the other.\nNonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from\na renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time\nas of late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more inter-\nesting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.\nThere is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s Ethicsthat\ngoes: “It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of\nexactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is\nequally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a\nmathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an ora-\ntor.” The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle\nbetween that of a mathematician and of an orator.\nAt various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood\nat the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-\nous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to\nuse the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor’s\ncomposite index (or S & P500), because it is more comprehensive\nand representative of the general market than the 30-stock DJIA.\nWe shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four\ndates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,\n1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take\nthe convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times\nin 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.\nFor our earnings figures we present both the last year’s showing\nand the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use\nthe last twelve months’ figures; and for 1971 bond interest and\nwholesale prices those of August 1971.\nThe 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in\nOctober 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same\nas in 1958, but much higher than in the early years of the long bull\nwww.fx1618.comsraeY\nsuoiraV\nni\nxednI\netisopmoC\ns’rooP&\ndradnatS\not\ngnitaleR\nataD\n3-3\nELBAT\n1791\n8691\n3691\n8591\n3591\n8491\naraeY\nd001\n9.301\n20.57\n12.55\n18.42\n02.51\necirp\ngnisolC\n32.5\n67.5\n20.4\n98.2\n15.2\n42.2\nraey\ntnerruc\nni\ndenraE\n35.5\n73.5\n36.3\n22.2\n44.2\n56.1\nsraey\n3 tsal\nfo\nsgninrae\negarevA\n01.3\n99.2\n82.2\n57.1\n84.1\n39.\nraey\ntnerruc\nni\ndnediviD\n%75.7\n%15.6\n%63.4\n%21.4\n%80.3\n%77.2\natseretni\ndnob\nedarg-hgiH\n3.411\n7.801\n0.501\n4.001\n7.29\n9.78\nxedni\necirp-elaselohW\n:soitaR\n(cid:1)\n2.91\n(cid:1)\n0.81\n(cid:1)\n6.81\n(cid:1)\n4.81\n(cid:1)\n9.9\n(cid:1)\n3.6\nsgninrae\ns’raey\ntsal/ecirP\n(cid:1)\n1.81\n(cid:1)\n5.91\n(cid:1)\n7.02\n(cid:1)\n6.71\n(cid:1)\n2.01\n(cid:1)\n2.9\nsgninrae\n’sraey-3/ecirP\n%35.5\n%51.5\n%\n8.4\n%\n8.5\n%\n8.9\n%\n9.01\nc”dleiy\nsgninrae“\n’sraeY-3\n%11.3\n%78.2\n%40.3\n%\n3.3\n%\n5.5\n%\n6.5\ndleiy\ndnediviD\n(cid:1)27.\n(cid:1)08.\n(cid:1)01.1\n(cid:1)14.1\n(cid:1)02.3\n(cid:1)69.3\ndleiy\ndnob/dleiy\nsgninrae-kcotS\n(cid:1)14.\n(cid:1)44.\n(cid:1)07.\n(cid:1)08.\n(cid:1)\n8.1\n(cid:1)\n1.2\ndleiy\ndnob/dleiy\ndnediviD\n%\n5.11\n%\n5.11\n%\n5.01\n%\n8.21\n%\n8.11\n%\n2.11\neeulav\nkoob/sgninraE\n.sdnobAAAP&\nS\nno\ndleiYa\n.1791\nenuJ\ndedne\nraey\nsulp\n,8691–8491\nni\nsraey\nradnelaCb\n.%\nni\n,ecirp\neht\nyb\ndedivid\nsgninrae\neht\nsnaem\n”dleiy\nsgninraE“c\n.AIJD\neht\nrof\n009\not\ntnelaviuqe\n,1791\n.tcO\nni\necirPd\n.serugif\negareva\nraey-eerhTe\nwww.fx1618.com78 The Intelligent Investor\nmarket. This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-\nstrued to indicate that the market was especially high in January\n1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought\ninto the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The\nreader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-\nings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire\nperiod, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,\nby this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When\ndividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the\nrelationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. In\nthe early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds\nyield twice as much, and more, than stocks.\nOur final judgment is that the adverse change in the bond-\nyield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio\nfor late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view\nof the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was\nsome 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-\npoint of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the\n1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)\nIn terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still\nappear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-\nfered in 1969–1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a\nnew stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in\n1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during\n1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of\nlow-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too\nearly (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.\nHence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is\nlacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November\n1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-\nlook would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the\n900 DJIAlevel before the next serious setback or collapse. But we\ncannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,\nthe early-1971-market’s disregard of the harrowing experiences of\nless than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness\ngo unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-\ncult times ahead—perhaps in the form of a fairly quick replay of\nthe the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-\nmarket fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.3\nwww.fx1618.comACentury of Stock-Market History 79\nWhat Course to Follow\nTurn back to what we said in the last edition, reproduced on\np. 75.

He looks\ntwo years ahead, foreseeing the “catastrophic” bear market of\n1973–1974, in which U.S. stocks lost 37% of their value.1 He also\nlooks more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of\nmarket gurus and best-selling books that were not even on the horizon\nin his lifetime.\nThe heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must\nnever forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortu-\nnately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in\nthe 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance pro-\nfessor Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (1994)—culminating,\nin a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett’s Dow\n36,000, David Elias’ Dow 40,000, and Charles Kadlec’s Dow\n100,000 (all published in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had\nreturned an annual average of 7% after inflation ever since 1802.\nTherefore, they concluded, that’s what investors should expect in the\nfuture.\nSome bulls went further. Since stocks had “always” beaten bonds\nover any period of at least 30 years, stocks must be less risky than\nbonds or even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of\nowning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why\n1If dividewndws awre. nfoxt1 in6cl1ud8ed.c, sotomcks fell 47.8% in those two years.\n80Commentary on Chapter 3 81\nquibble over how much you pay for them in the first place? (To find out\nwhy, see the sidebar on p. 82.)\nIn 1999 and early 2000, bull-market baloney was everywhere:\n• On December 7, 1999, Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the\nFirsthand mutual funds, appeared on CNN’s Moneyline telecast.\nAsked if wireless telecommunication stocks were overvalued—\nwith many trading at infinite multiples of their earnings—Landis\nhad a ready answer. “It’s not a mania,” he shot back. “Look at the\noutright growth, the absolute value of the growth. It’s big.”\n• On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist\nat the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal: “It’s a\nnew world order. We see people discard all the right companies\nwith all the right people with the right vision because their stock\nprice is too high—that’s the worst mistake an investor can make.”\n• In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek, Jeffrey M. Apple-\ngate, then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers,\nasked rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two\nyears ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.”\nBut the answer is yes.It always has been. It always will be.\nAnd when Graham asked, “Can such heedlessness go unpun-\nished?” he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no.Like an\nenraged Greek god, the stock market crushed everyone who had\ncome to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some\nkind of divine right. Just look at how those forecasts by Landis,\nFroelich, and Applegate held up:\n• From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis’s pet wire-\nless stocks, Nokia, lost “only” 67%—while the worst, Winstar\nCommunications, lost 99.9%.\n• Froelich’s favorite stocks—Cisco Systems and Motorola—fell more\nthan 70% by late 2002. Investors lost over $400 billion on Cisco\nalone—more than the annual economic output of Hong Kong,\nIsrael, Kuwait, and Singapore combined.\n• In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the\nDow Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite\nIndex was at 4446. By the end of 2002, the Dow was hobbling\naround the 8,300 level, while NASDAQ had withered to roughly\n1w3w00w—e.rfaxd1ic6at1in8g .acll oitsm gains over the previous six years.SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST\nThere was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have “always”\nbeaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do\nnot exist. The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market’s\nearliest returns contain as few as seven (yes, 7!) stocks.1 By\n1800, however, there were some 300 companies in America\n(many in the Jeffersonian equivalents of the Internet: wooden\nturnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and their investors\nlost their knickers.\nBut the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went\nbust in those early years, a problem technically known as “sur-\nvivorship bias.” Thus these indexes wildly overstate the results\nearned by real-life investors—who lacked the 20/20 hindsight\nnecessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy. A lonely\nhandful of companies, including Bank of New York and J. P. Mor-\ngan Chase, have prospered continuously since the 1790s. But\nfor every such miraculous survivor, there were thousands of\nfinancial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Penn-\nsylvania Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers’s Gap Turn-\npike Co.—all omitted from the “historical” stock indexes.\nJeremy Siegel’s data show that, after inflation, from 1802\nthrough 1870 stocks gained 7.0% per year, bonds 4.8%, and\ncash 5.1%. But Elroy Dimson and his colleagues at London\nBusiness School estimate that the pre-1871 stock returns are\noverstated by at least two percentage points per year.2 In the\nreal world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds—and\nperhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term\nrecord “proves” that stocks are guaranteed to outperform\nbonds or cash is an ignoramus.\n1By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan-\ncial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the\nrambunctious young American stock market.\n2See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time,May 6, 2002,\np. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between 1871 and\nthe 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds of automobile,\naviation, and radio companies that went bust without a trace. These returns,\ntoo, are probably overstated by one to two percentage points.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 3 83\nTHE HIGHER THEY GO,\nTHE HARDER THEY FALL\nAs the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham\nurges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.\nWhy should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their\npast returns? When every investor comes to believe that stocks are\nguaranteed to make money in the long run, won’t the market end up\nbeing wildly overpriced? And once that happens, how can future\nreturns possibly be high?\nGraham’s answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common\nsense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function\nof the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering\naway, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the\nworld was at peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean—\nthat stocks were worth buying at any price.Since the profits that com-\npanies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to\npay for stocks must also be finite.\nThink of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the great-\nest basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Sta-\ndium like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by\npaying Jordan up to $34 million a year to bounce a big leather ball\naround a wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have\nbeen justified paying him $340 million, or $3.4 billion, or $34 billion,\nper season.\nTHE LIMITS OF OPTIMISM\nFocusing on the market’s recent returns when they have been rosy,\nwarns Graham, will lead to “a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion\nthat equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks\nin the future.” From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least\n20% each year—a surge unprecedented in American history—stock\nbuyers became ever more optimistic:\n• In mid-1998, investors surveyed by the Gallup Organization for\nthe PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn\nan average of roughly 13% over the year to come. By early 2000,\ntheir average expected return had jumped to more than 18%.\nwww.fx1618.com84 Commentary on Chapter 3\n• “Sophisticated professionals” were just as bullish, jacking up their\nown assumptions of future returns. In 2001, for instance, SBC\nCommunications raised the projected return on its pension plan\nfrom 8.5% to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return\non the pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock index had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.\nA quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:\n• Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of\none-year returns on stocks had slumped to 7%—even though\ninvestors could now buy at prices nearly 50% lower than in\n2000.2\n• Those gung-ho assumptions about the returns on their pension\nplans will cost the companies in the S & P 500 a bare minimum of\n$32 billion between 2002 and 2004, according to recent Wall\nStreet estimates.\nEven though investors all know they’re supposed to buy low and\nsell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s\nwarning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more\nenthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,\nthe more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run. On\nMarch 24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at\n$14.75 trillion. By October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, the total\nU.S. stock market was worth $7.34 trillion, or 50.2% less—a loss of\n$7.41 trillion. Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bear-\nish, predicting flat or even negative market returns for years—even\ndecades—to come.\nAt this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering\nhow calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed\non something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe\nthem now?\n2Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’ expec-\ntation of a 7% stock return will be realized.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 3 85\nWHAT’S NEXT?\nInstead, let’s tune out the noise and think about future returns as Gra-\nham might. The stock market’s performance depends on three factors:\n• real growth (the rise of companies’ earnings and dividends)\n• inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the\neconomy)\n• speculative growth—or decline (any increase or decrease in the\ninvesting public’s appetite for stocks)\nIn the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share\nhas averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).3 As of early 2003,\ninflation was running around 2.4% annually; the dividend yield on\nstocks was 1.9%. So,\n1.5% to 2%\n+ 2.4%\n+ 1.9%\n= 5.8% to 6.3%\nIn the long run, that means you can reasonably expect stocks to\naverage roughly a 6% return (or 4% after inflation). If the investing\npublic gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that\nspeculative fever will temporarily drive returns higher. If, instead,\ninvestors are full of fear, as they were in the 1930s and 1970s, the\nreturns on stocks will go temporarily lower. (That’s where we are in\n2003.)\nRobert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham\ninspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index against average corporate\nprofits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the histori-\ncal record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20,\nthe market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well\n3See Jeremy Siegel, Stocks for the Long Run(McGraw-Hill, 2002), p. 94,\nand Robert Arnott and William Bernstein, “The Two Percent Dilution,” work-\ning paper, July, 2002.\nwww.fx1618.com86 Commentary on Chapter 3\nbelow 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road. In\nearly 2003, by Shiller’s math, stocks were priced at about 22.8 times\nthe average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decade—still in the\ndanger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times\nearnings in December 1999.\nHow has the market done in the past when it was priced around\ntoday’s levels? Figure 3-1 shows the previous periods when stocks\nwere at similar highs, and how they fared over the 10-year stretches\nthat followed:\nFIGURE 3-1\nPrice/earnings ratio Total return over\nYear next 10 years\n1898 21.4 (cid:2) 9.2\n1900 20.7 (cid:2) 7.1\n1901 21.7 (cid:2) 5.9\n1905 19.6 (cid:2) 5.0\n1929 22.0 (cid:2)0.1\n1936 21.1 (cid:2) 4.4\n1955 18.9 (cid:2)11.1\n1959 18.6 (cid:2) 7.8\n1961 22.0 (cid:2) 7.1\n1962 18.6 (cid:2) 9.9\n1963 21.0 (cid:2) 6.0\n1964 22.8 (cid:2) 1.2\n1965 23.7 (cid:2) 3.3\n1966 19.7 (cid:2) 6.6\n1967 21.8 (cid:2) 3.6\n1968 22.3 (cid:2) 3.2\n1972 18.6 (cid:2) 6.7\n1992 20.4 (cid:2) 9.3\nAverages 20.8 (cid:2) 6.0\nSources: http://aida.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data/ie_data.htm;\nJack Wilson and Charles Jones, “An Analysis of the S &P500 Index and Cowles’\nExtensions: Price Index and Stock Returns, 1870–1999,” The Journal of Business, vol.\n75, no. 3, July, 2002, pp. 527–529; Ibbotson Associates.\nNotes: Price/earnings ratio is Shiller calculation (10-year average real earnings of\nS & P500-stock index divided by December 31 index value).

I think Graham,\never the conservative, would split the difference between the lowest\nand highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks\nwill earn roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that\nprojection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added\ntogether real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.)\nCompared to the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it’s a whisker better\nthan the gains that bonds are likely to produce—and reason enough for\nmost investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.\nBut there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing\nyou can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that\nyou will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that\nthe past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always!\nAnd the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will\nmost brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their\nviews about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecast-\ning powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a\nview of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.\nSo, by all means, you should lower your expectations—but take care\nnot to depress your spirit. For the intelligent investor, hope always\nsprings eternal, because it should.In the financial markets, the worse\nthe future looks, the better it usually turns out to be. A cynic once told\nG. K. Chesterton, the British novelist and essayist, “Blessed is he who\nexpecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.” Chesterton’s\nrejoinder? “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy\neverything.”\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 4\nGeneral Portfolio Policy:\nThe Defensive Investor\nT\nhe basic characteristics of an investment portfolio are usually\ndetermined by the position and characteristics of the owner or\nowners. At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance\ncompanies, and so-called legal trust funds. Ageneration ago their\ninvestments were limited by law in many states to high-grade\nbonds and, in some cases, high-grade preferred stocks. At the other\nextreme we have the well-to-do and experienced businessman,\nwho will include any kind of bond or stock in his security list pro-\nvided he considers it an attractive purchase.\nIt has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot\nafford to take risks should be content with a relatively low return\non their invested funds. From this there has developed the general\nnotion that the rate of return which the investor should aim for is\nmore or less proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run.\nOur view is different. The rate of return sought should be depen-\ndent, rather, on the amount of intelligent effort the investor is will-\ning and able to bring to bear on his task. The minimum return goes\nto our passive investor, who wants both safety and freedom from\nconcern. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and\nenterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and\nskill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be less real risk\nassociated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the chance of a\nlarge profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding about\n41⁄%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves sus-\n2\npected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bonds\nlost a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in\ninterest rates.\nwww.fx1618.com\n88General Portfolio Policy 89\nThe Basic Problem of Bond-Stock Allocation\nWehave already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of\nthe defensive investor.* He should divide his funds between high-\ngrade bonds and high-grade common stocks.\nWe have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the\ninvestor should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his\nfunds in common stocks, with a consequent inverse range of\nbetween 75% and 25% in bonds. There is an implication here that\nthe standard division should be an equal one, or 50–50, between\nthe two major investment mediums. According to tradition the\nsound reason for increasing the percentage in common stocks\nwould be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in a\nprotracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call\nfor reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in\nthe judgment of the investor the market level has become danger-\nously high.\nThese copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate\nand always difficult to follow—because they go against that very\nhuman nature which produces that excesses of bull and bear mar-\nkets. It is almost a contradiction in terms to suggest as a feasible\npolicy for the averagestockowner that he lighten his holdings when\nthe market advances beyond a certain point and add to them after\na corresponding decline. It is because the average man operates,\nand apparently must operate, in opposite fashion that we have had\nthe great advances and collapses of the past; and—this writer\nbelieves—we are likely to have them in the future.\nIf the division between investment and speculative operations\nwere as clear now as once it was, we might be able to envisage\ninvestors as a shrewd, experienced group who sell out to the heed-\nless, hapless speculators at high prices and buy back from them at\ndepressed levels. This picture may have had some verisimilitude in\nbygone days, but it is hard to identify it with financial develop-\nments since 1949. There is no indication that such professional\noperations as those of the mutual funds have been conducted in\nthis fashion. The percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the\n*See Graham’s “Conclusion” to Chapter 2, p. 56–57.\nwww.fx1618.com90 The Intelligent Investor\ntwo major types of funds—“balanced” and “common-stock”—has\nchanged very little from year to year. Their selling activities have\nbeen largely related to endeavors to switch from less to more\npromising holdings.\nIf, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact\nwith its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established,\nthen we can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce\nhis common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild\nthem later to the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the\ninvestor should not have more than one-half in equities unless he\nhas strong confidence in the soundness of his stock position and is\nsure that he could view a market decline of the 1969–70 type with\nequanimity. It is hard for us to see how such strong confidence can\nbe justified at the levels existing in early 1972. Thus we would\ncounsel against a greater than 50% apportionment to common\nstocks at this time. But, for complementary reasons, it is almost\nequally difficult to advise a reduction of the figure well below 50%,\nunless the investor is disquieted in his own mind about the current\nmarket level, and will be satisfied also to limit his participation in\nany further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.\nWeare thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may\nappear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the\nguiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal divi-\nsion between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the mar-\nket level have raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%,\nthe balance would be restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock\nportfolio and the transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a\nfall in the common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use\nof one-eleventh of the bond fund to buy additional equities.\nYale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number\nof years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% “normal hold-\ning” in common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to\nhave given up its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its\nportfolio in equities (including some convertibles). (At that time\nthe endowment funds of 71 such institutions, totaling $7.6 billion,\nheld 60.3% in common stocks.) The Yale example illustrates the\nalmost lethal effect of the great market advance upon the once pop-\nularformula approachto investment. Nonetheless we are convinced\nthat our 50–50 version of this approach makes good sense for the\nwww.fx1618.comGeneral Portfolio Policy 91\ndefensive investor. It is extremely simple; it aims unquestionably in\nthe right direction; it gives the follower the feeling that he is at least\nmaking some moves in response to market developments; most\nimportant of all, it will restrain him from being drawn more and\nmore heavily into common stocks as the market rises to more and\nmore dangerous heights.\nFurthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with\nthe gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a\nsevere decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how\nmuch better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.\nWhile our proposed 50–50 division is undoubtedly the simplest\n“all-purpose program” devisable, it may not turn out to be the best\nin terms of results achieved. (Of course, no approach, mechanical\nor otherwise, can be advanced with any assurance that it will work\nout better than another.) The much larger income return now\noffered by good bonds than by representative stocks is a potent\nargument for favoring the bond component. The investor’s choice\nbetween 50% or a lower figure in stocks may well rest mainly on\nhis own temperament and attitude. If he can act as a cold-blooded\nweigher of the odds, he would be likely to favor the low 25% stock\ncomponent at this time, with the idea of waiting until the DJIAdiv-\nidend yield was, say, two-thirds of the bond yield before he would\nestablish his median 50–50 division between bonds and stocks.\nStarting from 900 for the DJIA and dividends of $36 on the unit,\nthis would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 71⁄% to\n2\nabout 5.5% without any change in the present return on leading\nstocks, or a fall in the DJIAto as low as 660 if there is no reduction\nin bond yields and no increase in dividends. A combination of\nintermediate changes could produce the same “buying point.” A\nprogram of that kind is not especially complicated; the hard part is\nto adopt it and to stick to it not to mention the possibility that it\nmay turn out to have been much too conservative.\nThe Bond Component\nThe choice of issues in the bond component of the investor’s\nportfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy tax-\nable or tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-term\nmaturities? The tax decision should be mainly a matter of arith-\nwww.fx1618.com92 The Intelligent Investor\nmetic, turning on the difference in yields as compared with the\ninvestor’s tax bracket. In January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturi-\nties was between obtaining, say, 71⁄% on “grade Aa” corporate\n2\nbonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free issues. (The term “municipals” is\ngenerally applied to all species of tax-exempt bonds, including\nstate obligations.) There was thus for this maturity a loss in income\nof some 30% in passing from the corporate to the municipal field.\nHence if the investor was in a maximum tax bracket higher than\n30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the munic-\nipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A\nsingle person starts paying a 30% rate when his income after\ndeductions passes $10,000; for a married couple the rate applies\nwhen combined taxable income passes $20,000. It is evident that a\nlarge proportion of individual investors would obtain a higher\nreturn after taxes from good municipals than from good corporate\nbonds.\nThe choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a\ndifferent question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself\nagainst a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a\nlower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable\ngainin principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in\nChapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.\nFor a period of many years in the past the only sensible bond\npurchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety\nwas—and is—unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other\nbond investments of first quality; they had a money-back option\nand other privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In\nour earlier editions we had an entire chapter entitled “U.S. Savings\nBonds: ABoon to Investors.”\nAs we shall point out, U.S. savings bonds still possess certain\nunique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individ-\nual investor. For the man of modest capital—with, say, not more\nthan $10,000 to put into bonds—we think they are still the easiest\nand the best choice. But those with larger funds may find other\nmediums more desirable.\nLet us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor con-\nsideration, and discuss them briefly with respect to general\ndescription, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and\nother features.\nwww.fx1618.comGeneral Portfolio Policy 93\n1.u.s. savings bonds, series e and series h.Weshall first sum-\nmarize their important provisions, and then discuss briefly the\nnumerous advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly\nconvenient investments. The Series H bonds pay interest semi-\nannually, as do other bonds. The rate is 4.29% for the first year, and\nthen a flat 5.10% for the next nine years to maturity. Interest on the\nSeries E bonds is not paid out, but accrues to the holder through\nincrease in redemption value. The bonds are sold at 75% of their\nface value, and mature at 100% in 5 years 10 months after purchase.\nIf held to maturity the yield works out at 5%, compounded semi-\nannually. If redeemed earlier, the yield moves up from a minimum\nof 4.01% in the first year to an average of 5.20% in the next 45⁄ years.\n6\nInterest on the bonds is subject to Federal income tax, but is\nexempt from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the\nSeries E bonds may be paid at the holder’s option either annually\nas the interest accrues (through higher redemption value), or not\nuntil the bond is actually disposed of.\nOwners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly\nafter purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series\nH bonds have similar rights to cash them in at par value (cost).\nSeries E bonds are exchangeable for Series H bonds, with certain\ntax advantages. Bonds lost, destroyed, or stolen may be replaced\nwithout cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but liberal\nprovisions for co-ownership by family members make it possible\nfor most investors to buy as many as they can afford. Comment:\nThere is no other investment that combines (1) absolute assurance\nof principal and interest payments, (2) the right to demand full\n“money back” at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5% inter-\nest rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of Series\nE bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and\nthus to continue to accumulate annual values at successively\nhigher rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long\nperiods has been of great dollar advantage; we calculate it has\nincreased the effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a\nthird in typical cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at\ncost price or better has given the purchasers in former years of low\ninterest rates complete protection against the shrinkage in princi-\npal value that befell many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave\nthem the possibility of benefiting from the rise in interest rates by\nwww.fx1618.com94 The Intelligent Investor\nswitching their low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues\non an even-money basis.\nIn our view the special advantages enjoyed by owners of sav-\nings bonds now will more than compensate for their lower current\nreturn as compared with other direct government obligations.\n2.other united states bonds.Aprofusion of these issues exists,\ncovering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates. All of\nthem are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and\nprincipal. They are subject to Federal income taxes but free from\nstate income tax. In late 1971 the long-term issues—over ten years—\nshowed an average yield of 6.09%, intermediate issues (three to five\nyears) returned 6.35%, and short issues returned 6.03%.\nIn 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large dis-\ncounts. Some of these are accepted at par in settlement of estate\ntaxes. Example: The U.S. Treasury 31⁄s due 1990 are in this category;\n2\nthey sold at 60 in 1970, but closed 1970 above 77.\nIt is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect obli-\ngations of the U.S. government yield appreciably more than its\ndirect obligations of the same maturity. As we write, an offering\nappears of 7.05% of “Certificates Fully Guaranteed by the Secretary\nof Transportation of the Department of Transportation of the\nUnited States.” The yield was fully 1% more than that on direct\nobligations of the U.S., maturing the same year (1986). The certifi-\ncates were actually issued in the name of the Trustees of the Penn\nCentral Transportation Co., but they were sold on the basis of a\nstatement by the U.S. Attorney General that the guarantee “brings\ninto being a general obligation of the United States, backed by its\nfull faith and credit.” Quite a number of indirect obligations of this\nsort have been assumed by the U.S. government in the past, and all\nof them have been scrupulously honored.\nThe reader may wonder why all this hocus-pocus, involving an\napparently “personal guarantee” by our Secretary of Transporta-\ntion, and a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end. The chief reason\nfor the indirection has been the debt limit imposed on govern-\nment borrowing by the Congress. Apparently guarantees by the\ngovernment are not regarded as debts—a semantic windfall for\nshrewder investors. Perhaps the chief impact of this situation has\nbeen the creation of tax-free Housing Authority bonds, enjoying\nwww.fx1618.comGeneral Portfolio Policy 95\nthe equivalent of a U.S. guarantee, and virtually the only tax-\nexempt issues that are equivalent to government bonds. Another\ntype of government-backed issues is the recently created New\nCommunity Debentures, offered to yield 7.60% in September 1971.\n3. state and municipal bonds. These enjoy exemption from\nFederal income tax. They are also ordinarily free of income tax in\nthe state of issue but not elsewhere. They are either direct obliga-\ntions of a state or subdivision, or “revenue bonds” dependent for\ninterest payments on receipts from a toll road, bridge, building\nlease, etc. Not all tax-free bonds are strongly enough protected to\njustify their purchase by a defensive investor. He may be guided in\nhis selection by the rating given to each issue by Moody’s or Stan-\ndard & Poor’s. One of three highest ratings by both services—Aaa\n(AAA), Aa (AA), or A—should constitute a sufficient indication of\nadequate safety. The yield on these bonds will vary both with the\nquality and the maturity, with the shorter maturities giving the\nlower return. In late 1971 the issues represented in Standard &\nPoor’s municipal bond index averaged AA in quality rating, 20\nyears in maturity, and 5.78% in yield. A typical offering of\nVineland, N.J., bonds, rated AAfor Aand gave a yield of only 3%\non the one-year maturity, rising to 5.8% to the 1995 and 1996 matu-\nrities.1\n4.corporation bonds.These bonds are subject to both Federal\nand state tax. In early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 7.19%\nfor a 25-year maturity, as reflected in the published yield of\nMoody’s Aaa corporate bond index. The so-called lower-medium-\ngrade issues—rated Baa—returned 8.23% for long maturities. In\neach class shorter-term issues would yield somewhat less than\nlonger-term obligations.\nComment. The above summaries indicate that the average\ninvestor has several choices among high-grade bonds. Those in\nhigh income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield\nfrom good tax-free issues than from taxable ones. For others the\nearly 1972 range of taxable yield would seem to be from 5.00% on\nU.S. savings bonds, with their special options, to about 71⁄% on\n2\nhigh-grade corporate issues.\nwww.fx1618.com96 The Intelligent Investor\nHigher-Yielding Bond Investments\nBy sacrificing quality an investor can obtain a higher income\nreturn from his bonds. Long experience has demonstrated that the\nordinary investor is wiser to keep away from such high-yield\nbonds. While, taken as a whole, they may work out somewhat bet-\nter in terms of overall return than the first-quality issues, they\nexpose the owner to too many individual risks of untoward devel-\nopments, ranging from disquieting price declines to actual default.\n(It is true that bargain opportunities occur fairly often in lower-\ngrade bonds, but these require special study and skill to exploit\nsuccessfully.)*\nPerhaps we should add here that the limits imposed by Con-\ngress on direct bond issues of the United States have produced at\nleast two sorts of “bargain opportunities” for investors in the pur-\nchase of government-backed obligations. One is provided by the\ntax-exempt “New Housing” issues, and the other by the recently\ncreated (taxable) “New Community debentures.” An offering of\nNew Housing issues in July 1971 yielded as high as 5.8%, free from\nboth Federal and state taxes, while an issue of (taxable) New Com-\nmunity debentures sold in September 1971 yielded 7.60%. Both\nobligations have the “full faith and credit” of the United States\ngovernment behind them and hence are safe without question.\nAnd—on a net basis—they yield considerably more than ordinary\nUnited States bonds.†\n*Graham’s objection to high-yield bonds is mitigated today by the wide-\nspread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the research\nof owning “junk bonds.” See the commentary on Chapter 6 for more detail.\n†The “New Housing” bonds and “New Community debentures” are no\nmore. New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department\nof Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income\ntax, but they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures,\nalso backed by HUD, were authorized by a Federal law passed in 1968.\nAbout $350 million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the\nprogram was terminated in 1983.\nwww.fx1618.comGeneral Portfolio Policy 97\nSavings Deposits in Lieu of Bonds\nAn investor may now obtain as high an interest rate from a\nsavings deposit in a commercial or savings bank (or from a bank\ncertificate of deposit) as he can from a first-grade bond of short\nmaturity. The interest rate on bank savings accounts may be low-\nered in the future, but under present conditions they are a suitable\nsubstitute for short-term bond investment by the individual.\nConvertible Issues\nThese are discussed in Chapter 16. The price variability of bonds\nin general is treated in Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctu-\nations.\nCall Provisions\nIn previous editions we had a fairly long discussion of this\naspect of bond financing, because it involved a serious but little\nnoticed injustice to the investor. In the typical case bonds were\ncallable fairly soon after issuance, and at modest premiums—say\n5%—above the issue price. This meant that during a period of wide\nfluctuations in the underlying interest rates the investor had to\nbear the full brunt of unfavorable changes and was deprived of all\nbut a meager participation in favorable ones.\nExample: Our standard example has been the issue of American\nGas & Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101 in\n1928. Four years later, under near-panic conditions, the price of\nthese good bonds fell to 621⁄, yielding 8%. By 1946, in a great rever-\n2\nsal, bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3%, and the 5%\nissueshouldhave been quoted at close to 160. But at that point the\ncompany took advantage of the call provision and redeemed the\nissue at a mere 106.\nThe call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised\ninstance of “heads I win, tails you lose.” At long last, the bond-\nbuying institutions refused to accept this unfair arrangement; in\nrecent years most long-term high-coupon issues have been pro-\ntected against redemption for ten years or more after issuance. This\nstill limits their possible price rise, but not inequitably.\nwww.fx1618.com98 The Intelligent Investor\nIn practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to\nsacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of non-\ncallability—say for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage\nin buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-\ncoupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For\nthe discount—e.g., of a 31⁄% bond at 631⁄%, yielding 7.85%—carries\n2 2\nfull protection against adverse call action.\nStraight—i.e., Nonconvertible—Preferred Stocks\nCertain general observations should be made here on the subject\nof preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist,\nbut they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an\ninherently bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent\nfor his safety on the ability and desire of the company to pay divi-\ndends on its common stock. Once the common dividends are omit-\nted, or even in danger, his own position becomes precarious, for\nthe directors are under no obligation to continue paying him unless\nthey also pay on the common. On the other hand, the typical pre-\nferred stock carries no share in the company’s profits beyond the\nfixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks both the legal\nclaim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit possibilities of\na common shareholder (or partner).\nThese weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend\nto come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a\nsmall percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched\nas to maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicis-\nsitudes. Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is\nwhen their price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At\nsuch times they may be well suited to the aggressive investor but\ntoo unconventional for the defensive investor.)\nIn other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not\nat all. We shall refer later to convertible and similarly privileged\nissues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are\nnot ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.\nAnother peculiarity in the general position of preferred stocks\n*Abond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays a rate of\ninterest iwncowmwe b.efxlow1 6th1e m8a.rckeot maverage.General Portfolio Policy 99\ndeserves mention. They have a much better tax status for corpora-\ntion buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income\ntax on only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the\nfull amount of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corpo-\nrate rate is 48%, this means that $100 received as preferred-stock\ndividends is taxed only $7.20, whereas $100 received as bond inter-\nest is taxed $48. On the other hand, individual investors pay\nexactly the same tax on preferred-stock investments as on bond\ninterest, except for a recent minor exemption. Thus, in strict logic,\nall investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corpo-\nrations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by investors\nwho pay income tax.*\nSecurity Forms\nThe bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto dis-\ncussed, are well-understood and relatively simple matters. Abond-\nholder is entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal\non a definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a\nfixed dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any com-\nmon dividend. His principal value does not come due on any spec-\nified date. (The dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He\nmay or may not have a vote.)\nThe above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the\nmajority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable\ndepartures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible\nand similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest\ndoes not have to be paid unless it is earned by the company.\n(Unpaid interest may accumulate as a charge against future earn-\nings, but the period is often limited to three years.)\nIncome bonds should be used by corporations much more\n*While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed. Corpora-\ntions can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from dividends,\nand the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a corporation would pay\nroughly $24.50 in tax on $100 in dividends from preferred stock versus\n$35 in tax on $100 in interest income. Individuals pay the same rate of\nincome tax on dividend income that they do on interest income, so preferred\nstockw ofwferws t.hfexm1 n6o 1ta8x a.dcvoanmtage.100 The Intelligent Investor\nextensively than they are. Their avoidance apparently arises from a\nmere accident of economic history—namely, that they were first\nemployed in quantity in connection with railroad reorganizations,\nand hence they have been associated from the start with financial\nweakness and poor investment status. But the form itself has sev-\neral practical advantages, especially in comparison with and in\nsubstitution for the numerous (convertible) preferred-stock issues\nof recent years. Chief of these is the deductibility of the interest\npaid from the company’s taxable income, which in effect cuts the\ncost of that form of capital in half. From the investor’s standpoint it\nis probably best for him in most cases that he should have (1) an\nunconditional right to receive interest payments when they are\nearned by the company, and (2) a right to other forms of protection\nthan bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and paid. The\nterms of income bonds can be tailored to the advantage of both\nthe borrower and the lender in the manner best suited to both.\n(Conversion privileges can, of course, be included.) The acceptance\nby everybody of the inherently weak preferred-stock form and\nthe rejection of the stronger income-bond form is a fascinating\nillustration of the way in which traditional institutions and habits\noften tend to persist on Wall Street despite new conditions calling\nfor a fresh point of view. With every new wave of optimism or\npessimism, we are ready to abandon history and time-tested prin-\nciples, but we cling tenaciously and unquestioningly to our preju-\ndices.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 4\nWhen you leave it to chance, then all of a sudden you don’t\nhave any more luck.\n—Basketball coach Pat Riley\nH\now aggressive should your portfolio be?\nThat, says Graham, depends less on what kinds of investments you\nown than on what kind of investor you are. There are two ways to be\nan intelligent investor:\n• by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic\nmix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;\n• or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and\nrequires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).\nGraham calls the first approach “active” or “enterprising”; it takes\nlots of time and loads of energy. The “passive” or “defensive” strategy\ntakes little time or effort but requires an almost ascetic detachment\nfrom the alluring hullabaloo of the market. As the investment thinker\nCharles Ellis has explained, the enterprising approach is physically\nand intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally\ndemanding.1\nIf you have time to spare, are highly competitive, think like a sports\nfan, and relish a complicated intellectual challenge, then the active\n1For more about the distinction between physically and intellectually difficult\ninvesting on the one hand, and emotionally difficult investing on the other,\nsee Chapter 8 and also Charles D.

Vertin, eds., The Investor’s Anthol-\nogy(John Wiley & Sons, 1997), p. 72.\nwww.fx1618.com\n101102 Commentary on Chapter 4\napproach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave simplicity,\nand don’t relish thinking about money, then the passive approach is for\nyou. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining both meth-\nods—creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly passive, or\nvice versa.)\nBoth approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful\nwith either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right\none, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep\nyour costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction between\nactive and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial\nrisk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in our\ninvestments—but also within ourselves.\nCAN YOU BE BRAVE, OR WILL YOU CAVE?\nHow, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and most\nbasic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in\nbonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discus-\nsion after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge\nthat inflation is one of your worst enemies.)\nThe most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allo-\ncate your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions\nthe word “age.” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of con-\nventional wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you ought\nto take depends mainly on how old you are.2A traditional rule of thumb\nwas to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your\nassets in stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old would\nput 72% of her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19%\nthere.) Like everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the\nlate 1990s. By 1999, a popular book argued that if you were younger\nthan 30 you should put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had\nonly a “moderate” tolerance for risk!3\n2A recent Google search for the phrase “age and asset allocation” turned\nup more than 30,000 online references.\n3James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett, Dow 36,000: The New Strategy\nfor Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market (Times Business,\n1999), p. 250.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 4 103\nUnless you’ve allowed the proponents of this advice to subtract\n100 from your IQ, you should be able to tell that something is wrong\nhere. Why should your age determine how much risk you can take?\nAn 89-year-old with $3 million, an ample pension, and a gaggle of\ngrandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds.\nShe already has plenty of income, and her grandchildren (who will\neventually inherit her stocks) have decades of investing ahead of\nthem. On the other hand, a 25-year-old who is saving for his wedding\nand a house down payment would be out of his mind to put all his\nmoney in stocks. If the stock market takes an Acapulco high dive, he\nwill have no bond income to cover his downside—or his backside.\nWhat’s more, no matter how young you are, you might suddenly\nneed to yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now, but 40\nminutes from now. Without a whiff of warning, you could lose your job,\nget divorced, become disabled, or suffer who knows what other kind\nof surprise. The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone\nmust keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash.\nFinally, many people stop investing precisely because the stock\nmarket goes down. Psychologists have shown that most of us do a\nvery poor job of predicting today how we will feel about an emotionally\ncharged event in the future.4When stocks are going up 15% or 20%\na year, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, it’s easy to imagine that\nyou and your stocks are married for life. But when you watch every\ndollar you invested getting bashed down to a dime, it’s hard to resist\nbailing out into the “safety” of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and\nholding their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, and\nholding nothing but their own head in their hands. Because so few\ninvestors have the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market, Graham\ninsists that everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. That\ncushion, he argues, will give you the courage to keep the rest of your\nmoney in stocks even when stocks stink.\nToget a better feel for how much risk you can take, think about the\nfundamental circumstances of your life, when they will kick in, when\nthey might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for cash:\n4For a fascinating essay on this psychological phenomenon, see Daniel\nGilbert and Timothy Wilson’s “Miswanting,” at www.wjh.harvard.edu/~dtg/\nGilbert_&_Wilson(Miswanting).pdf.\nwww.fx1618.com104 Commentary on Chapter 4\n• Are you single or married?

If not, then steer mostly\nclear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s maximum of 75% in bonds\nor cash. (To find out whether you can go up to 100%, see the\nsidebar on p. 105.)\nOnce you set these target percentages, change them only as your\nlife circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stock\nmarket has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The\nvery heart of Graham’s approach is to replace guesswork with disci-\npline. Fortunately, through your 401(k), it’s easy to put your portfolio\non permanent autopilot. Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high\nlevel of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. If\nthe stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have\njust under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.5Visit your 401(k)’s\nwebsite (or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock\nfunds to “rebalance” back to your 70–30 target.

Anyone who panicked\nin the last bear market is going to panic in the next one—and will\nregret having no cushion of cash and bonds.\ndrive yourself crazy, and not so seldom that your targets will get out\nof whack. I suggest that you rebalance every six months, no more\nand no less, on easy-to-remember dates like New Year’s and the\nFourth of July.\nThe beauty of this periodic rebalancing is that it forces you to base\nyour investing decisions on a simple, objective standard—Do I now\nown more of this asset than my plan calls for?—instead of the sheer\nguesswork of where interest rates are heading or whether you think\nthe Dow is about to drop dead. Some mutual-fund companies, includ-\ning T.

Short-term or long-term? Today there is a third: Bonds or\nbond funds?\nTaxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,6 you\nshould buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirement\naccounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the\nhands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your\n401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no current\ntax on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since\ntheir tax advantage goes to waste.7\nShort-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on\nopposite ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—\nalthough a short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the\nother hand, if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-term\nbond will outperform shorter ones.8You can split the difference simply\n6For the 2003 tax year, the bottom Federal tax bracket is for single people\nearning less than $28,400 or married people (filing jointly) earning less than\n$47,450.\n7Two good online calculators that will help you compare the after-tax in-\ncome of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at www.investinginbonds.\ncom/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To\ndecide if a “muni” is right for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” gener-\nated by these calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently\navailable on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or\nwww.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds is\nhigher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any case,\nbe warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and\nmore price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative mini-\nmum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the\nadvantages of municipal bonds.\n8For an excellent introduction to bond investing, see http://flagship.van\nguard.com/web/planret/AdvicePTIBInvestmentsInvestingInBonds.html#Inter\nestRates.

For most investors, intermediate bonds are the sim-\nplest choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing\nwhat interest rates will do.\nBonds or bond funds?Since bonds are generally sold in $10,000\nlots and you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the\nrisk that any one of them might go bust, buying individual bonds\nmakes no sense unless you have at least $100,000 to invest. (The\nonly exception is bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury, since they’re pro-\ntected against default by the full force of the American government.)\nBond funds offer cheap and easy diversification, along with the\nconvenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into\nthe fund at current rates without paying a commission. For most\ninvestors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the main\nexceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major\nfirms like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and T.

Fixed annuities\noffer a set rate of return; variable ones provide a fluctuating return. But\nwhat the defensive investor really needs to defend against here are the\nhard-selling insurance agents, stockbrokers, and financial planners who\npeddle annuities at rapaciously high costs. In most cases, the high\nexpenses of owning an annuity—including “surrender charges” that gnaw\naway at your early withdrawals—will overwhelm its advantages. The few\ngood annuities are bought, not sold; if an annuity produces fat commis-\nsions for the seller, chances are it will produce meager results for the\nbuyer. Consider only those you can buy directly from providers with rock-\nbottom costs like Ameritas, TIAA-CREF, and Vanguard.11\n11In general, variable annuities are not attractive for investors under the age\nof 50 who expect to be in a high tax bracket during retirement or who have\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 4 111\nPreferred stock. Preferred shares are a worst-of-both-worlds\ninvestment. They are less secure than bonds, since they have only a\nsecondary claim on a company’s assets if it goes bankrupt. And they\noffer less profit potential than common stocks do, since companies\ntypically “call” (or forcibly buy back) their preferred shares when inter-\nest rates drop or their credit rating improves. Unlike the interest pay-\nments on most of its bonds, an issuing company cannot deduct\npreferred dividend payments from its corporate tax bill. Ask yourself: If\nthis company is healthy enough to deserve my investment, why is it\npaying a fat dividend on its preferred stock instead of issuing bonds\nand getting a tax break? The likely answer is that the company is not\nhealthy, the market for its bonds is glutted, and you should approach\nits preferred shares as you would approach an unrefrigerated dead\nfish.\nCommon stock. A visit to the stock screener at http://screen.\nyahoo.com/stocks.html in early 2003 showed that 115 of the stocks in\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500 index had dividend yields of 3.0% or\ngreater. No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for yield, would\never buy a stock for its dividend income alone; the company and its\nbusinesses must be solid, and its stock price must be reasonable.\nBut, thanks to the bear market that began in 2000, some leading\nstocks are now outyielding Treasury bonds. So even the most defen-\nsive investor should realize that selectively adding stocks to an all-\nbond or mostly-bond portfolio can increaseits income yield—and raise\nits potential return.12\nnot already contributed the maximum to their existing 401(k) or IRA\naccounts.

We have commented on the\nconverse situation that has developed in the ensuing 20 years,\nwhereby the big advance in stock prices made them appear safe\nand profitable investments at record high levels which might actu-\nally carry with them a considerable degree of risk.†\nThe argument we made for common stocks in 1949 turned on\n*At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by stocks\nover the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term Treasury\nbonds—meaning that $10,000 invested in stocks would have grown to\n$18,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have\nturned into $21,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous\ntime to buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock\nindex gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best long-term\nreturns in the history of the U.S. stock market.\n†Graham’s earlier comments on this subject appear on pp. 19–20. Just\nimagine what he would have thought about the stock market of the late\n1990s, in which each new record-setting high was considered further\n“proof” that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!\nwww.fx1618.com\n112The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 113\ntwo main points. The first was that they had offered a considerable\ndegree of protection against the erosion of the investor’s dollar\ncaused by inflation, whereas bonds offered no protection at all. The\nsecond advantage of common stocks lay in their higher average\nreturn to investors over the years. This was produced both by an\naverage dividend income exceeding the yield on good bonds and\nby an underlying tendency for market value to increase over the\nyears in consequence of the reinvestment of undistributed profits.\nWhile these two advantages have been of major importance—\nand have given common stocks a far better record than bonds\nover the long-term past—we have consistently warned that these\nbenefits could be lost by the stock buyer if he pays too high a price\nfor his shares. This was clearly the case in 1929, and it took 25 years\nfor the market level to climb back to the ledge from which it\nhad abysmally fallen in 1929–1932.* Since 1957 common stocks\nhave once again, through their high prices, lost their traditional\nadvantage in dividend yield over bond interest rates.† It remains to\n*The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of 381.17\non September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until November 23,\n1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit 382.74. (When you\nsay you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do you realize just how long\nthe long run can be—or that many investors who bought in 1929 were no\nlonger even alive by 1954?) However, for patient investors who reinvested\ntheir income, stock returns were positive over this otherwise dismal period,\nsimply because dividend yields averaged more than 5.6% per year. Accord-\ning to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London\nBusiness School, if you had invested $1 in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent\nall your dividends, your stock portfolio would have grown to $198 by 2000.\nBut if you had reinvested all your dividends, your stock portfolio would have\nbeen worth $16,797! Far from being an afterthought, dividends are the\ngreatest force in stock investing.\n†Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A stock’s\nyield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one share of common\nstock. If a company pays a $2 annual dividend when its stock price is $100\nper share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price doubles while the dividend\nstays constant, the dividend yield will drop to 1%. In 1959, when the trend\nGraham spotted in 1957 became noticeable to everyone, most Wall Street\nwww.fx1618.com114 The Intelligent Investor\nbe seen whether the inflation factor and the economic-growth fac-\ntor will make up in the future for this significantly adverse devel-\nopment.\nIt should be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm\nfor common stocks in general at the 900 DJIAlevel of late 1971. For\nreasons already given* we feel that the defensive investor cannot\nafford to be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks\nin his portfolio, even if he must regard them as the lesser of two\nevils—the greater being the risks attached to an all-bond holding.\nRules for the Common-Stock Component\nThe selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive\ninvestor should be a relatively simple matter. Here we would sug-\ngest four rules to be followed:\n1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversifica-\ntion. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a\nmaximum of about thirty.†\n2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and con-\nservatively financed. Indefinite as these adjectives must be, their\ngeneral sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the\nend of the chapter.\n3. Each company should have a long record of continuous divi-\ndend payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-\npundits declared that it could not possibly last. Never before had stocks\nyielded less than bonds; after all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why\nwould anyone buy them at all unless they pay extra dividend income to com-\npensate for their greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield\nstocks for a few months at most, and then things would revert to “normal.”\nMore than four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again;\nthe yield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on\nbonds.\n*See pp. 56–57 and 88–89.\n†For another view of diversification, see the sidebar in the commentary on\nChapter 14 (p. 368).\nwww.fx1618.comThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 115\nage met this dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this\npoint we would suggest the requirement of continuous dividend\npayments beginning at least in 1950.*\n4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will\npay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the\npast seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such\naverage earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last\ntwelve-month period. But such a restriction would eliminate\nnearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the port-\nfolio. In particular, it would ban virtually the entire category of\n“growth stocks,” which have for some years past been the favorites\nof both speculators and institutional investors. We must give our\nreasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.\nGrowth Stocks and the Defensive Investor\nThe term “growth stock” is applied to one which has increased\nits per-share earnings in the past at well above the rate for common\nstocks generally and is expected to continue to do so in the future.\n(Some authorities would say that a true growth stock should be\nexpected at least to double its per-share earnings in ten years—i.e.,\nto increase them at a compounded annual rate of over 7.1%.)†\nObviously stocks of this kind are attractive to buy and to own, pro-\nvided the price paid is not excessive. The problem lies there, of\n*Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10 years of\ncontinuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from consideration\nonly one member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average—Microsoft—and\nwould still leave at least 317 stocks to choose from among the S & P 500\nindex). Even insisting on 20 years of uninterrupted dividend payments would\nnot be overly restrictive; according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in\nthe S & P 500 met that standard as of year-end 2002.\n†The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of time an\namount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed growth rate\ninto 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years (72 divided by\n6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock will double its\nearnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1 years).\nwww.fx1618.com116 The Intelligent Investor\ncourse, since growth stocks have long sold at high prices in relation\nto current earnings and at much higher multiples of their average\nprofits over a past period. This has introduced a speculative ele-\nment of considerable weight in the growth-stock picture and has\nmade successful operations in this field a far from simple matter.\nThe leading growth issue has long been International Business\nMachines, and it has brought phenomenal rewards to those who\nbought it years ago and held on to it tenaciously. But we have\nalready pointed out* that this “best of common stocks” actually\nlost 50% of its market price in a six-months’ decline during 1961–62\nand nearly the same percentage in 1969–70. Other growth stocks\nhave been even more vulnerable to adverse developments; in some\ncases not only has the price fallen back but the earnings as well,\nthus causing a double discomfiture to those who owned them. A\ngood second example for our purpose is Texas Instruments, which\nin six years rose from 5 to 256, without paying a dividend, while its\nearnings increased from 40 cents to $3.91 per share. (Note that the\nprice advanced five times as fast as the profits; this is characteristic\nof popular common stocks.) But two years later the earnings had\ndropped off by nearly 50% and the price by four-fifths,to 49.†\nThe reader will understand from these instances why we regard\ngrowth stocks as a whole as too uncertain and risky a vehicle for\nthe defensive investor. Of course, wonders can be accomplished\nwith the right individual selections, bought at the right levels, and\nlater sold after a huge rise and before the probable decline. But the\naverage investor can no more expect to accomplish this than to find\nmoney growing on trees. In contrast we think that the group of\n*Graham makes this point on p. 73.\n†To show that Graham’s observations are perennially true, we can substi-\ntute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty years apart,\nthe results are uncannily similar: Microsoft’s stock dropped 55.7% from\n2000 through 2002, while Cisco’s stock—which had risen roughly 50-fold\nover the previous six years—lost 76% of its value from 2000 through 2002.\nAs with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco’s stock price was sharper than\nthe fall in its earnings, which dropped just 39.2% (comparing the three-year\naverage for 1997–1999 against 2000–2002). As always, the hotter they\nare, the harder they fall.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 117\nlarge companies that are relatively unpopular, and therefore\nobtainable at reasonable earnings multipliers,* offers a sound if\nunspectacular area of choice by the general public. We shall illus-\ntrate this idea in our chapter on portfolio selection.\nPortfolio Changes\nIt is now standard practice to submit all security lists for peri-\nodic inspection in order to see whether their quality can be\nimproved. This, of course, is a major part of the service provided\nfor clients by investment counselors. Nearly all brokerage houses\nare ready to make corresponding suggestions, without special fee,\nin return for the commission business involved. Some brokerage\nhouses maintain investment services on a fee basis.\nPresumably our defensive investor should obtain—at least once\na year—the same kind of advice regarding changes in his portfolio\nas he sought when his funds were first committed. Since he will\nhave little expertness of his own on which to rely, it is essential that\nhe entrust himself only to firms of the highest reputation; other-\nwise he may easily fall into incompetent or unscrupulous hands. It\nis important, in any case, that at every such consultation he make\nclear to his adviser that he wishes to adhere closely to the four\nrules of common-stock selection given earlier in this chapter. Inci-\ndentally, if his list has been competently selected in the first\ninstance, there should be no need for frequent or numerous\nchanges.†\n*“Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios, which\nmeasure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared to the\nprofitability of the underlying business. (See footnote † on p. 70 in Chapter 3.)\n†Investors can now set up their own automated system to monitor the\nquality of their holdings by using interactive “portfolio trackers” at such web-\nsites as www.quicken.com, moneycentral.msn.com, finance.yahoo.com, and\nwww.morningstar.com. Graham would, however, warn against relying exclu-\nsively on such a system; you must use your own judgment to supplement\nthe software.\nwww.fx1618.com118 The Intelligent Investor\nDollar-Cost Averaging\nThe New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into\npopularizing its “monthly purchase plan,” under which an\ninvestor devotes the same dollar amount each month to buying\none or more common stocks. This is an application of a special type\nof “formula investment” known as dollar-cost averaging. During\nthe predominantly rising-market experience since 1949 the results\nfrom such a procedure were certain to be highly satisfactory, espe-\ncially since they prevented the practitioner from concentrating his\nbuying at the wrong times.\nIn Lucile Tomlinson’s comprehensive study of formula invest-\nment plans,1 the author presented a calculation of the results of\ndollar-cost averaging in the group of stocks making up the Dow\nJones industrial index. Tests were made covering 23 ten-year pur-\nchase periods, the first ending in 1929, the last in 1952. Every test\nshowed a profit either at the close of the purchase period or within\nfive years thereafter. The average indicated profit at the end of the\n23 buying periods was 21.5%, exclusive of dividends received.\nNeedless to say, in some instances there was a substantial tempo-\nrary depreciation at market value. Miss Tomlinson ends her discus-\nsion of this ultrasimple investment formula with the striking\nsentence: “No one has yet discovered any other formula for invest-\ning which can be used with so much confidence of ultimate suc-\ncess, regardless of what may happen to security prices, as Dollar\nCost Averaging.”\nIt may be objected that dollar-cost averaging, while sound in\nprinciple, is rather unrealistic in practice, because few people are so\nsituated that they can have available for common-stock investment\nthe same amount of money each year for, say, 20 years. It seems to\nme that this apparent objection has lost much of its force in recent\nyears. Common stocks are becoming generally accepted as a neces-\nsary component of a sound savings-investment program. Thus,\nsystematic and uniform purchases of common stocks may present\nno more psychological and financial difficulties than similar con-\ntinuous payments for United States savings bonds and for life\ninsurance—to which they should be complementary. The monthly\namount may be small, but the results after 20 or more years can be\nimpressive and important to the saver.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 119\nThe Investor’s Personal Situation\nAt the beginning of this chapter we referred briefly to the posi-\ntion of the individual portfolio owner. Let us return to this matter,\nin the light of our subsequent discussion of general policy. To what\nextent should the type of securities selected by the investor vary\nwith his circumstances? As concrete examples representing widely\ndifferent conditions, we shall take: (1) a widow left $200,000 with\nwhich to support herself and her children; (2) a successful doctor in\nmid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly accretions of\n$10,000; and (3) a young man earning $200 per week and saving\n$1,000 a year.*\nFor the widow, the problem of living on her income is a very dif-\nficult one. On the other hand the need for conservatism in her\ninvestments is paramount. A division of her fund about equally\nbetween United States bonds and first-grade common stocks is a\ncompromise between these objectives and corresponds to our gen-\neral prescription for the defensive investor. (The stock component\nmay be placed as high as 75% if the investor is psychologically pre-\npared for this decision, and if she can be almost certain she is not\nbuying at too high a level. Assuredly this is not the case in early\n1972.)\nWe do not preclude the possibility that the widow may qualify\nas an enterprising investor, in which case her objectives and meth-\nods will be quite different. The one thing the widow must notdo is\nto take speculative chances in order to “make some extra income.”\nBy this we mean trying for profits or high income without the nec-\nessary equipment to warrant full confidence in overall success. It\nwould be far better for her to draw $2,000 per year out of her prin-\ncipal, in order to make both ends meet, than to risk half of it in\npoorly grounded, and therefore speculative, ventures.\nThe prosperous doctor has none of the widow’s pressures and\ncompulsions, yet we believe that his choices are pretty much the\nsame. Is he willing to take a serious interest in the business of\ninvestment? If he lacks the impulse or the flair, he will do best to\n*To update Graham’s figures, take each dollar amount in this section and\nmultiply it by five.\nwww.fx1618.com120 The Intelligent Investor\naccept the easy role of the defensive investor. The division of his\nportfolio should then be no different from that of the “typical”\nwidow, and there would be the same area of personal choice in fix-\ning the size of the stock component. The annual savings should be\ninvested in about the same proportions as the total fund.\nThe average doctor may be more likely than the average widow\nto elect to become an enterprising investor, and he is perhaps more\nlikely to succeed in the undertaking. He has one important handi-\ncap, however—the fact that he has less time available to give to his\ninvestment education and to the administration of his funds. In\nfact, medical men have been notoriously unsuccessful in their secu-\nrity dealings. The reason for this is that they usually have an ample\nconfidence in their own intelligence and a strong desire to make a\ngood return on their money, without the realization that to do so\nsuccessfully requires both considerable attention to the matter and\nsomething of a professional approach to security values.\nFinally, the young man who saves $1,000 a year—and expects to\ndo better gradually—finds himself with the same choices, though\nfor still different reasons. Some of his savings should go automati-\ncally into Series E bonds. The balance is so modest that it seems\nhardly worthwhile for him to undergo a tough educational and\ntemperamental discipline in order to qualify as an aggressive\ninvestor. Thus a simple resort to our standard program for the\ndefensive investor would be at once the easiest and the most logi-\ncal policy.\nLet us not ignore human nature at this point. Finance has a fasci-\nnation for many bright young people with limited means. They\nwould like to be both intelligent and enterprising in the placement\nof their savings, even though investment income is much less\nimportant to them than their salaries. This attitude is all to the\ngood. There is a great advantage for the young capitalist to begin\nhis financial education and experience early. If he is going to oper-\nate as an aggressive investor he is certain to make some mistakes\nand to take some losses. Youth can stand these disappointments\nand profit by them. We urge the beginner in security buying not to\nwaste his efforts and his money in trying to beat the market. Let\nhim study security values and initially test out his judgment on\nprice versus value with the smallest possible sums.\nThus we return to the statement, made at the outset, that the\nwww.fx1618.comThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 121\nkind of securities to be purchased and the rate of return to be\nsought depend not on the investor’s financial resources but on his\nfinancial equipment in terms of knowledge, experience, and tem-\nperament.\nNote on the Concept of “Risk”\nIt is conventional to speak of good bonds as less risky than good\npreferred stocks and of the latter as less risky than good common\nstocks. From this was derived the popular prejudice against com-\nmon stocks because they are not “safe,” which was demonstrated\nin the Federal Reserve Board’s survey of 1948. We should like to\npoint out that the words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securi-\nties in two different senses, with a resultant confusion in thought.\nAbond is clearly proved unsafe when it defaults its interest or\nprincipal payments. Similarly, if a preferred stock or even a com-\nmon stock is bought with the expectation that a given rate of divi-\ndend will be continued, then a reduction or passing of the\ndividend means that it has proved unsafe. It is also true that an\ninvestment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility that the\nholder may have to sell at a time when the price is well below cost.\nNevertheless, the idea of risk is often extended to apply to a pos-\nsible decline in the price of a security, even though the decline may\nbe of a cyclical and temporary nature and even though the holder\nis unlikely to be forced to sell at such times. These chances are pres-\nent in all securities, other than United States savings bonds, and to\na greater extent in the general run of common stocks than in senior\nissues as a class. But we believe that what is here involved is not a\ntrue risk in the useful sense of the term. The man who holds a\nmortgage on a building might have to take a substantial loss if he\nwere forced to sell it at an unfavorable time. That element is not\ntaken into account in judging the safety or risk of ordinary real-\nestate mortgages, the only criterion being the certainty of punctual\npayments. In the same way the risk attached to an ordinary com-\nmercial business is measured by the chance of its losing money, not\nby what would happen if the owner were forced to sell.\nIn Chapter 8 we shall set forth our conviction that the bona fide\ninvestor does not lose money merely because the market price of\nhis holdings declines; hence the fact that a decline may occur does\nwww.fx1618.com122 The Intelligent Investor\nnot mean that he is running a true risk of loss. If a group of well-\nselected common-stock investments shows a satisfactory overall\nreturn, as measured through a fair number of years, then this\ngroup investment has proved to be “safe.” During that period its\nmarket value is bound to fluctuate, and as likely as not it will sell\nfor a while under the buyer’s cost. If that fact makes the investment\n“risky,” it would then have to be called both risky and safe at the\nsame time. This confusion may be avoided if we apply the concept\nof risk solely to a loss of value which either is realized through\nactual sale, or is caused by a significant deterioration in the\ncompany’s position—or, more frequently perhaps, is the result of\nthe payment of an excessive price in relation to the intrinsic worth\nof the security.2\nMany common stocks do involve risks of such deterioration. But\nit is our thesis that a properly executed group investment in com-\nmon stocks does not carry any substantial risk of this sort and that\ntherefore it should not be termed “risky” merely because of the ele-\nment of price fluctuation. But such risk is present if there is danger\nthat the price may prove to have been clearly too high by intrinsic-\nvalue standards—even if any subsequent severe market decline\nmay be recouped many years later.\nNote on the Category of “Large, Prominent,\nand Conservatively Financed Corporations”\nThe quoted phrase in our caption was used earlier in the chapter\nto describe the kind of common stocks to which defensive\ninvestors should limit their purchases—provided also that they\nhad paid continuous dividends for a considerable number of years.\nAcriterion based on adjectives is always ambiguous. Where is the\ndividing line for size, for prominence, and for conservatism of\nfinancial structure? On the last point we can suggest a specific stan-\ndard that, though arbitrary, is in line with accepted thinking. An\nindustrial company’s finances are not conservative unless the com-\nmon stock (at book value) represents at least half of the total capi-\ntalization, including all bank debt.3 For a railroad or public utility\nthe figure should be at least 30%.\nThe words “large” and “prominent” carry the notion of substan-\ntial size combined with a leading position in the industry. Such\nwww.fx1618.comThe Defensive Investor and Common Stocks 123\ncompanies are often referred to as “primary”; all other common\nstocks are then called “secondary,” except that growth stocks are\nordinarily placed in a separate class by those who buy them as\nsuch. To supply an element of concreteness here, let us suggest that\nto be “large” in present-day terms a company should have $50 mil-\nlion of assets or do $50 million of business.* Again to be “promi-\nnent” a company should rank among the first quarter or first third\nin size within its industry group.\nIt would be foolish, however, to insist upon such arbitrary crite-\nria. They are offered merely as guides to those who may ask for\nguidance. But any rule which the investor may set for himself and\nwhich does no violence to the common-sense meanings of “large”\nand “prominent” should be acceptable. By the very nature of the\ncase there must be a large group of companies that some will and\nothers will not include among those suitable for defensive invest-\nment. There is no harm in such diversity of opinion and action. In\nfact, it has a salutary effect upon stock-market conditions, because\nit permits a gradual differentiation or transition between the cate-\ngories of primary and secondary stock issues.\n*In today’s markets, to be considered large, a company should have a total\nstock value (or “market capitalization”) of at least $10 billion.

And if you go about it the right\nway, investing in stocks is just as easy as parking your money in bonds\nand cash. (As we’ll see in Chapter 9, you can buy a stock-market index\nfund with no more effort than it takes to get dressed in the morning.)\nAmidst the bear market that began in 2000, it’s understandable if\nyou feel burned—and if, in turn, that feeling makes you determined\nnever to buy another stock again. As an old Turkish proverb says,\n“After you burn your mouth on hot milk, you blow on your yogurt.”\nBecause the crash of 2000–2002 was so terrible, many investors\nnow view stocks as scaldingly risky; but, paradoxically, the very act of\ncrashing has taken much of the risk out of the stock market. It was hot\nmilk before, but it is room-temperature yogurt now.\nViewed logically, the decision of whether to own stocks today has\nnothing to do with how much money you might have lost by owning\nthem a few years ago. When stocks are priced reasonably enough to\ngive you future growth, then you should own them, regardless of the\nlosses they may have cost you in the recent past. That’s all the more\ntrue when bond yields are low, reducing the future returns on income-\nproducing investments.\nwww.fx1618.com\n124Commentary on Chapter 5 125\nAs we have seen in Chapter 3, stocks are (as of early 2003) only\nmildly overpriced by historical standards. Meanwhile, at recent prices,\nbonds offer such low yields that an investor who buys them for their\nsupposed safety is like a smoker who thinks he can protect himself\nagainst lung cancer by smoking low-tar cigarettes. No matter how\ndefensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of low maintenance,\nor in the contemporary sense of low risk—today’s values mean that you\nmust keep at least some of your money in stocks.\nFortunately, it’s never been easier for a defensive investor to buy\nstocks. And a permanent autopilot portfolio, which effortlessly puts a\nlittle bit of your money to work every month in predetermined invest-\nments, can defend you against the need to dedicate a large part of\nyour life to stock picking.\nSHOULD YOU “BUY WHAT YOU KNOW”?\nBut first, let’s look at something the defensive investor must always\ndefend against: the belief that you can pick stocks without doing any\nhomework. In the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the most popular\ninvesting slogans was “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch—who from\n1977 through 1990 piloted Fidelity Magellan to the best track record\never compiled by a mutual fund—was the most charismatic preacher of\nthis gospel. Lynch argued that amateur investors have an advantage\nthat professional investors have forgotten how to use: “the power of\ncommon knowledge.” If you discover a great new restaurant, car,\ntoothpaste, or jeans—or if you notice that the parking lot at a nearby\nbusiness is always full or that people are still working at a company’s\nheadquarters long after Jay Leno goes off the air—then you have a per-\nsonal insight into a stock that a professional analyst or portfolio man-\nager might never pick up on. As Lynch put it, “During a lifetime of\nbuying cars or cameras, you develop a sense of what’s good and\nwhat’s bad, what sells and what doesn’t...and the most important\npart is, you know it before Wall Street knows it.”1\nLynch’s rule—“You can outperform the experts if you use your edge\nby investing in companies or industries you already understand”—isn’t\n1Peter Lynch with John Rothchild, One Up on Wall Street(Penguin, 1989),\np. 23.\nwww.fx1618.com126 Commentary on Chapter 5\ntotally implausible, and thousands of investors have profited from it\nover the years. But Lynch’s rule can work only if you follow its corollary\nas well: “Finding the promising company is only the first step. The next\nstep is doing the research.” To his credit, Lynch insists that no one\nshould ever invest in a company, no matter how great its products or\nhow crowded its parking lot, without studying its financial statements\nand estimating its business value.\nUnfortunately, most stock buyers have ignored that part.\nBarbra Streisand, the day-trading diva, personified the way people\nabuse Lynch’s teachings. In 1999 she burbled, “We go to Starbucks\nevery day, so I buy Starbucks stock.” But the Funny Girl forgot that no\nmatter how much you love those tall skinny lattes, you still have to ana-\nlyze Starbucks’s financial statements and make sure the stock isn’t\neven more overpriced than the coffee. Countless stock buyers made\nthe same mistake by loading up on shares of Amazon.com because\nthey loved the website or buying e*Trade stock because it was their\nown online broker.\n“Experts” gave the idea credence too. In an interview televised on\nCNN in late 1999, portfolio manager Kevin Landis of the Firsthand\nFunds was asked plaintively, “How do you do it? Why can’t I do it,\nKevin?” (From 1995 through the end of 1999, the Firsthand Technol-\nogy Value fund produced an astounding 58.2% average annualized\ngain.) “Well, you cando it,” Landis chirped. “All you really need to do is\nfocus on the things that you know, and stay close to an industry, and\ntalk to people who work in it every day.”2\nThe most painful perversion of Lynch’s rule occurred in corporate\nretirement plans. If you’re supposed to “buy what you know,” then\nwhat could possibly be a better investment for your 401(k) than your\nown company’s stock? After all, you work there; don’t you know more\nabout the company than an outsider ever could? Sadly, the employees\n2Kevin Landis interview on CNN In the Money,November 5, 1999, 11 A.M.\neastern standard time. If Landis’s own record is any indication, focusing on\n“the things that you know” is not “all you really need to do” to pick stocks\nsuccessfully. From the end of 1999 through the end of 2002, Landis’s fund\n(full of technology companies that he claimed to know “firsthand” from his\nbase in Silicon Valley) lost 73.2% of its value, an even worse pounding than\nthe average technology fund suffered over that period.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 5 127\nof Enron, Global Crossing, and WorldCom—many of whom put nearly\nall their retirement assets in their own company’s stock, only to be\nwiped out—learned that insiders often possess only the illusion of\nknowledge, not the real thing.\nPsychologists led by Baruch Fischhoff of Carnegie Mellon Univer-\nsity have documented a disturbing fact: becoming more familiar with a\nsubject does not significantly reduce people’s tendency to exaggerate\nhow much they actually know about it.3 That’s why “investing in what\nyou know” can be so dangerous; the more you know going in, the less\nlikely you are to probe a stock for weaknesses. This pernicious form of\noverconfidence is called “home bias,” or the habit of sticking to what is\nalready familiar:\n• Individual investors own three times more shares in their local\nphone company than in all other phone companies combined.\n• The typical mutual fund owns stocks whose headquarters are 115\nmiles closer to the fund’s main office than the average U.S. com-\npany is.\n• 401(k) investors keep between 25% and 30% of their retirement\nassets in the stock of their own company.4\nIn short, familiarity breeds complacency. On the TV news, isn’t it\nalways the neighbor or the best friend or the parent of the criminal who\nsays in a shocked voice, “He was such a nice guy”? That’s because\nwhenever we are too close to someone or something, we take our\nbeliefs for granted, instead of questioning them as we do when we con-\nfront something more remote. The more familiar a stock is, the more\nlikely it is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who thinks there’s\nno need to do any homework.

Through specialized online brokerages like www.\nsharebuilder.com, www.foliofn.com, and www.buyandhold.com, you\ncan buy stocks automatically even if you have very little cash to spare.\nThese websites charge as little as $4 for each periodic purchase of\nany of the thousands of U.S. stocks they make available. You can\ninvest every week or every month, reinvest the dividends, and even\ntrickle your money into stocks through electronic withdrawals from\nyour bank account or direct deposit from your paycheck. Sharebuilder\ncharges more to sell than to buy—reminding you, like a little whack\nacross the nose with a rolled-up newspaper, that rapid selling is an\ninvesting no-no—while FolioFN offers an excellent tax-tracking tool.\nUnlike traditional brokers or mutual funds that won’t let you in the door\nfor less than $2,000 or $3,000, these online firms have no minimum\naccount balances and are tailor-made for beginning investors who want\nto put fledgling portfolios on autopilot. To be sure, a transaction fee of\n$4 takes a monstrous 8% bite out of a $50 monthly investment—but if\nthat’s all the money you can spare, then these microinvesting sites are\nthe only game in town for building a diversified portfolio.\nYou can also buy individual stocks straight from the issuing compa-\nnies. In 1994, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission loos-\nened the handcuffs it had long ago clamped onto the direct sale of\nstocks to the public. Hundreds of companies responded by creating\nInternet-based programs allowing investors to buy shares without\ngoing through a broker. Some helpful online sources of information on\nbuying stocks directly include www.dripcentral.com, www.netstock\ndirect.com (an affiliate of Sharebuilder), and www.stockpower.com.\n5According to finance professor Charles Jones of Columbia Business\nSchool, the cost of a small, one-way trade (either a buy or a sell) in a New\nYork Stock Exchange–listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in Graham’s\nday to about 0.25% in 2000. For institutions like mutual funds, those costs\nare actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, “A Century of Stock Market Li-\nquidity anwd wTrawdin.fgx C1o6st1s,”8 at. chtotpm://papers.ssrn.com.)Commentary on Chapter 5 129\nYou may often incur a variety of nuisance fees that can exceed $25\nper year. Even so, direct-stock purchase programs are usually cheaper\nthan stockbrokers.\nBe warned, however, that buying stocks in tiny increments for years\non end can set off big tax headaches. If you are not prepared to keep\na permanent and exhaustively detailed record of your purchases, do\nnot buy in the first place. Finally, don’t invest in only one stock—or even\njust a handful of different stocks. Unless you are not willing to spread\nyour bets, you shouldn’t bet at all. Graham’s guideline of owning\nbetween 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors\nwho want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you\nare not overexposed to one industry.6 (For more on how to pick the\nindividual stocks that will make up your portfolio, see pp. 114–115\nand Chapters 11, 14, and 15.)\nIf, after you set up such an online autopilot portfolio, you find your-\nself trading more than twice a year—or spending more than an hour or\ntwo per month, total, on your investments—then something has gone\nbadly wrong. Do not let the ease and up-to-the-minute feel of the Inter-\nnet seduce you into becoming a speculator. A defensive investor\nruns—and wins—the race by sitting still.\nGet some help.A defensive investor can also own stocks through\na discount broker, a financial planner, or a full-service stockbroker. At a\ndiscount brokerage, you’ll need to do most of the stock-picking work\nyourself; Graham’s guidelines will help you create a core portfolio\nrequiring minimal maintenance and offering maximal odds of a steady\nreturn. On the other hand, if you cannot spare the time or summon the\ninterest to do it yourself, there’s no reason to feel any shame in hiring\nsomeone to pick stocks or mutual funds for you. But there’s one\nresponsibility that you must never delegate. You, and no one but you,\nmust investigate (before you hand over your money) whether an\nadviser is trustworthy and charges reasonable fees. (For more point-\ners, see Chapter 10.)\nFarm it out.

At relatively low cost, you\ncan buy a high degree of diversification and convenience—letting a\nprofessional pick and watch the stocks for you. In their finest form—\nindex portfolios—mutual funds can require virtually no monitoring or\nmaintenance whatsoever. Index funds are a kind of Rip Van Winkle\ninvestment that is highly unlikely to cause any suffering or surprises\neven if, like Washington Irving’s lazy farmer, you fall asleep for 20\nyears. They are a defensive investor’s dream come true. For more\ndetail, see Chapter 9.\nFILLING IN THE POTHOLES\nAs the financial markets heave and crash their way up and down day\nafter day, the defensive investor can take control of the chaos. Your\nvery refusal to be active, your renunciation of any pretended ability to\npredict the future, can become your most powerful weapons. By put-\nting every investment decision on autopilot, you drop any self-delusion\nthat you know where stocks are headed, and you take away the\nmarket’s power to upset you no matter how bizarrely it bounces.\nAs Graham notes, “dollar-cost averaging” enables you to put a fixed\namount of money into an investment at regular intervals. Every week,\nmonth, or calendar quarter, you buy more—whether the markets have\ngone (or are about to go) up, down, or sideways. Any major mutual fund\ncompany or brokerage firm can automatically and safely transfer the\nmoney electronically for you, so you never have to write a check or feel\nthe conscious pang of payment. It’s all out of sight, out of mind.\nThe ideal way to dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index\nfunds, which own every stock or bond worth having. That way, you\nrenounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going\nbut which sectors of the market—and which particular stocks or bonds\nwithin them—will do the best.\nLet’s say you can spare $500 a month. By owning and dollar-cost\naveraging into just three index funds—$300 into one that holds the\ntotal U.S. stock market, $100 into one that holds foreign stocks, and\n$100 into one that holds U.S. bonds—you can ensure that you own\nalmost every investment on the planet that’s worth owning.7 Every\n7For more on the rationale for keeping a portion of your portfolio in foreign\nstocks, sweew ppw. 1.8fx6–116871. 8.comCommentary on Chapter 5 131\nmonth, like clockwork, you buy more. If the market has dropped, your\npreset amount goes further, buying you more shares than the month\nbefore. If the market has gone up, then your money buys you fewer\nshares. By putting your portfolio on permanent autopilot this way, you\nprevent yourself from either flinging money at the market just when it is\nseems most alluring (and is actually most dangerous) or refusing to\nbuy more after a market crash has made investments truly cheaper\n(but seemingly more “risky”).\nAccording to Ibbotson Associates, the leading financial research\nfirm, if you had invested $12,000 in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock\nindex at the beginning of September 1929, 10 years later you would\nhave had only $7,223 left. But if you had started with a paltry $100\nand simply invested another $100 every single month, then by August\n1939, your money would have grown to $15,571! That’sthe power of\ndisciplined buying—even in the face of the Great Depression and the\nworst bear market of all time.8\nFigure 5-1 shows the magic of dollar-cost averaging in a more re-\ncent bear market.\nBest of all, once you build a permanent autopilot portfolio with\nindex funds as its heart and core, you’ll be able to answer every mar-\nket question with the most powerful response a defensive investor\ncould ever have: “I don’t know and I don’t care.” If someone asks\nwhether bonds will outperform stocks, just answer, “I don’t know and I\ndon’t care”—after all, you’re automatically buying both. Will health-care\nstocks make high-tech stocks look sick? “I don’t know and I don’t\ncare”—you’re a permanent owner of both. What’s the next Microsoft?\n“I don’t know and I don’t care”—as soon as it’s big enough to own,\nyour index fund will have it, and you’ll go along for the ride. Will foreign\nstocks beat U.S. stocks next year? “I don’t know and I don’t care”—if\nthey do, you’ll capture that gain; if they don’t, you’ll get to buy more at\nlower prices.\nBy enabling you to say “I don’t know and I don’t care,” a permanent\nautopilot portfolio liberates you from the feeling that you need to fore-\ncast what the financial markets are about to do—and the illusion that\n8Source: spreadsheet data provided courtesy of Ibbotson Associates.\nAlthough it was not possible for retail investors to buy the entire S & P 500\nindex until 1976, the example nevertheless proves the power of buying more\nwhenw stwocwk p.rficxe1s 6go1 d8ow.cn.om132 Commentary on Chapter 5\nFIGURE 5-1\nEvery Little Bit Helps\n6,000\n5,000\n$4,604.53\n4,000 $3,100.00\n3,000\n2,000\n1469.25\n1,000\n879.82\n0\nanyone else can.

There is a difficulty in discussing\nthis topic in orderly fashion, because there is no single or ideal pat-\ntern for aggressive operations. The field of choice is wide; the selec-\ntion should depend not only on the individual’s competence and\nequipment but perhaps equally well upon his interests and prefer-\nences.\nThe most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are\nof a negative sort.

Let him also avoid inferior types of bonds and pre-\nferred stocks unless they can be bought at bargain levels—which\nmeans ordinarily at prices at least 30% under par for high-coupon\n*Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in Chapter 1\nthat the definition of an “enterprising” investor depends not on the amount\nof risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing to put in, Graham\nfalls back on the conventional notion that enterprising investors are more\n“aggressive.” The rest of the chapter, however, makes clear that Graham\nstands by his original definition. (The great British economist John Maynard\nKeynes appears to have been the first to use the term “enterprise” as a syn-\nonym for analytical investment.)\nwww.fx1618.com\n133134 The Intelligent Investor\nissues, and much less for the lower coupons.* He will let someone\nelse buy foreign-government bond issues, even though the yield\nmay be attractive. He will also be wary of all kinds of new issues,\nincluding convertible bonds and preferreds that seem quite tempt-\ning and common stocks with excellent earnings confined to the\nrecent past.\nFor standard bond investments the aggressive investor would\ndo well to follow the pattern suggested to his defensive confrere,\nand make his choice between high-grade taxable issues, which can\nnow be selected to yield about 71⁄%, and good-quality tax-free\n4\nbonds, which yield up to 5.30% on longer maturities.†\nSecond-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks\nSince in late-1971 it is possible to find first-rate corporate bonds\nto yield 71⁄%, and even more, it would not make much sense to buy\n4\nsecond-grade issues merely for the higher return they offer. In fact\ncorporations with relatively poor credit standing have found it vir-\ntually impossible to sell “straight bonds”—i.e., nonconvertibles—\nto the public in the past two years. Hence their debt financing has\nbeen done by the sale of convertible bonds (or bonds with warrants\nattached), which place them in a separate category. It follows that\nvirtually all the nonconvertible bonds of inferior rating represent\nolder issues which are selling at a large discount. Thus they offer\nthe possibility of a substantial gain in principal value under favor-\nable future conditions—which would mean here a combination of\nan improved credit rating for the company and lower general\ninterest rates.\n*“High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average interest\nrates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks paying large divi-\ndend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high rates of interest in\norder to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal that it is risky. For more\non high-yield or “junk” bonds, see pp. 145–147.\n†As of early 2003, the equivalent yields are roughly 5.1% on high-grade\ncorporate bonds and 4.7% on 20-year tax-free municipal bonds. To up-\ndate these yields, see www.bondsonline.com/asp/news/composites/html or\nwww.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.html and www.bloomberg.com/markets/\npsamuni.whtmwl.w.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 135\nBut even in the matter of price discounts and resultant chance of\nprincipal gain, the second-grade bonds are in competition with bet-\nter issues. Some of the well-entrenched obligations with “old-\nstyle” coupon rates (21⁄% to 4%) sold at about 50 cents on the dollar\n2\nin 1970. Examples: American Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄s, due 1986\n8\nsold at 51; Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe RR 4s, due 1995, sold at 51;\nMcGraw-Hill 37⁄s, due 1992, sold at 501⁄.\n8 2\nHence under conditions of late-1971 the enterprising investors\ncan probably get from good-grade bonds selling at a large discount\nall that he should reasonably desire in the form of both income and\nchance of appreciation.\nThroughout this book we refer to the possibility that any well-\ndefined and protracted market situation of the past may return in\nthe future. Hence we should consider what policy the aggressive\ninvestor might have to choose in the bond field if prices and yields\nof high-grade issues should return to former normals. For this rea-\nson we shall reprint here our observations on that point made in\nthe 1965 edition, when high-grade bonds yielded only 41⁄%.\n2\nSomething should be said now about investing in second-grade\nissues, which can readily be found to yield any specified return up\nto 8% or more. The main difference between first- and second-\ngrade bonds is usually found in the number of times the interest\ncharges have been covered by earnings. Example: In early 1964\nChicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific 5% income debenture\nbonds, at 68, yielded 7.35%. But the total interest charges of the\nroad, before income taxes, were earned only 1.5 times in 1963,\nagainst our requirement of 5 times for a well-protected railroad\nissue.1\nMany investors buy securities of this kind because they “need\nincome” and cannot get along with the meager return offered by\ntop-grade issues. Experience clearly shows that it is unwise to buy\na bond or a preferred which lacks adequate safety merely because\nthe yield is attractive.* (Here the word “merely” implies that the\nissue is not selling at a large discount and thus does not offer an\nopportunity for a substantial gain in principal value.) Where such\nsecurities are bought at full prices—that is, not many points under\n*For a recent example that painfully reinforces Graham’s point, see p. 146\nbeloww. ww.fx1618.com136 The Intelligent Investor\n100*—the chances are very great that at some future time the\nholder will see much lower quotations. For when bad business\ncomes, or just a bad market, issues of this kind prove highly sus-\nceptible to severe sinking spells; often interest or dividends are\nsuspended or at least endangered, and frequently there is a pro-\nnounced price weakness even though the operating results are not\nat all bad.\nAs a specific illustration of this characteristic of second-quality\nsenior issues, let us summarize the price behavior of a group of ten\nrailroad income bondsin 1946–47. These comprise all of those which\nsold at 96 or more in 1946, their high prices averaging 1021⁄. By the\n2\nfollowing year the group had registered low prices averaging only\n68, a loss of one-third of the market value in a very short time.\nPeculiarly enough, the railroads of the country were showing\nmuch better earnings in 1947 than in 1946; hence the drastic price\ndecline ran counter to the business picture and was a reflection of\nthe selloff in the general market. But it should be pointed out that\nthe shrinkage in these income bonds was proportionately larger\nthan that in the common stocks in the Dow Jones industrial list\n(about 23%). Obviously the purchaser of these bonds at a cost\nabove 100 could not have expected to participate to any extent in a\nfurther rise in the securities market. The only attractive feature was\nthe income yield, averaging about 4.25% (against 2.50% for first-\ngrade bonds, an advantage of 1.75% in annual income). Yet the\nsequel showed all too soon and too plainly that for the minor\nadvantage in annual income the buyer of these second-grade\nbonds was risking the loss of a substantial part of his principal.\nThe above example permits us to pay our respects to the popu-\nlar fallacy that goes under the sobriquet of a “businessman’s\ninvestment.” That involves the purchase of a security showing a\nlarger yield than is obtainable on a high-grade issue and carrying\na correspondingly greater risk. It is bad business to accept an\n*Bond prices are quoted in percentages of “par value,” or 100. A bond\npriced at “85” is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond originally\noffered for $10,000, but now selling at 85, will cost $8,500. When bonds\nsell below 100, they are called “discount” bonds; above 100, they become\n“premium” bonds.\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 137\nacknowledged possibility of a loss of principal in exchange for a\nmere 1 or 2% of additional yearly income. If you are willing to\nassume some risk you should be certain that you can realize a\nreally substantial gain in principal value if things go well. Hence a\nsecond-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is almost always a bad\npurchase. The same issue at 70 might make more sense—and if you\nare patient you will probably be able to buy it at that level.\nSecond-grade bonds and preferred stocks possess two contra-\ndictory attributes which the intelligent investor must bear clearly\nin mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking spells in bad markets. On\nthe other hand, a large proportion recover their position when\nfavorable conditions return, and these ultimately “work out all\nright.” This is true even of (cumulative) preferred stocks that fail to\npay dividends for many years. There were a number of such issues\nin the early 1940s, as a consequence of the long depression of the\n1930s. During the postwar boom period of 1945–1947 many of\nthese large accumulations were paid off either in cash or in new\nsecurities, and the principal was often discharged as well. As a\nresult, large profits were made by people who, a few years previ-\nously, had bought these issues when they were friendless and sold\nat low prices.2\nIt may well be true that, in an overall accounting, the higher\nyields obtainable on second-grade senior issues will prove to have\noffset those principal losses that were irrecoverable. In other\nwords, an investor who bought all such issues at their offering\nprices might conceivably fare as well, in the long run, as one who\nlimited himself to first-quality securities; or even somewhat better.3\nBut for practical purposes the question is largely irrelevant.\nRegardless of the outcome, the buyer of second-grade issues at full\nprices will be worried and discommoded when their price declines\nprecipitately. Furthermore, he cannot buy enough issues to assure\nan “average” result, nor is he in a position to set aside a portion of\nhis larger income to offset or “amortize” those principal losses\nwhich prove to be permanent. Finally, it is mere common sense to\nabstain from buying securities at around 100 if long experience\nindicates that they can probably be bought at 70 or less in the next\nweak market.\nwww.fx1618.com138 The Intelligent Investor\nForeign Government Bonds\nAll investors with even small experience know that foreign\nbonds, as a whole, have had a bad investment history since 1914.\nThis was inevitable in the light of two world wars and an interven-\ning world depression of unexampled depth. Yet every few years\nmarket conditions are sufficiently favorable to permit the sale of\nsome new foreign issues at a price of about par. This phenomenon\ntells us a good deal about the working of the average investor’s\nmind—and not only in the field of bonds.\nWehave no concrete reasonto be concerned about the future his-\ntory of well-regarded foreign bonds such as those of Australia or\nNorway. But we do know that, if and when trouble should come,\nthe owner of foreign obligations has no legal or other means of\nenforcing his claim. Those who bought Republic of Cuba 41⁄s as\n2\nhigh as 117 in 1953 saw them default their interest and then sell as\nlow as 20 cents on the dollar in 1963. The New York Stock\nExchange bond list in that year also included Belgian Congo 51⁄s at\n4\n36, Greek 7s at 30, and various issues of Poland as low as 7. How\nmany readers have any idea of the repeated vicissitudes of the 8%\nbonds of Czechoslovakia, since they were first offered in this coun-\ntry in 1922 at 961⁄? They advanced to 112 in 1928, declined to 673⁄ in\n2 4\n1932, recovered to 106 in 1936, collapsed to 6 in 1939, recovered\n(unbelievably) to 117 in 1946, fell promptly to 35 in 1948, and sold\nas low as 8 in 1970!\nYears ago an argument of sorts was made for the purchase of\nforeign bonds here on the grounds that a rich creditor nation such\nas ours was under moral obligation to lend abroad. Time, which\nbrings so many revenges, now finds us dealing with an intractable\nbalance-of-payments problem of our own, part of which is ascrib-\nable to the large-scale purchase of foreign bonds by American\ninvestors seeking a small advantage in yield. For many years past\nwe have questioned the inherent attractiveness of such invest-\nments from the standpoint of the buyer; perhaps we should add\nnow that the latter would benefit both his country and himself if he\ndeclined these opportunities.\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 139\nNew Issues Generally\nIt might seem ill-advised to attempt any broad statements about\nnew issues as a class, since they cover the widest possible range of\nquality and attractiveness. Certainly there will be exceptions to any\nsuggested rule. Our one recommendation is that all investors\nshould be wary of new issues—which means, simply, that these\nshould be subjected to careful examination and unusually severe\ntests before they are purchased.\nThere are two reasons for this double caveat. The first is that\nnew issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls\ntherefore for a special degree of sales resistance.* The second is that\nmost new issues are sold under “favorable market conditions”—\nwhich means favorable for the seller and consequently less favor-\nable for the buyer.†\nThe effect of these considerations becomes steadily more impor-\ntant as we go down the scale from the highest-quality bonds\nthrough second-grade senior issues to common-stock flotations at\nthe bottom. A tremendous amount of financing, consisting of the\nrepayment of existing bonds at call price and their replacement by\nnew issues with lower coupons, was done in the past. Most of this\nwas in the category of high-grade bonds and preferred stocks. The\nbuyers were largely financial institutions, amply qualified to pro-\ntect their interests. Hence these offerings were carefully priced to\n*New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or IPOs—normally are\nsold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in commission) of 7%. By con-\ntrast, the buyer’s commission on older shares of common stock typically\nranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes roughly twice as much for\nselling something new as it does for selling something old, the new will get\nthe harder sell.\n†Recently, finance professors Owen Lamont of the University of Chicago\nand Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that corpora-\ntions choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock market is near\na peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see Lamont’s “Evaluating\nValue Weighting: Corporate Events and Market Timing” and Schultz’s\n“Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance of IPOs” at http://\npapers.ssrn.com.\nwww.fx1618.com140 The Intelligent Investor\nmeet the going rate for comparable issues, and high-powered\nsalesmanship had little effect on the outcome. As interest rates fell\nlower and lower the buyers finally came to pay too high a price for\nthese issues, and many of them later declined appreciably in the\nmarket. This is one aspect of the general tendency to sell new secu-\nrities of all types when conditions are most favorable to the issuer;\nbut in the case of first-quality issues the ill effects to the purchaser\nare likely to be unpleasant rather than serious.\nThe situation proves somewhat different when we study the\nlower-grade bonds and preferred stocks sold during the 1945–46\nand 1960–61 periods. Here the effect of the selling effort is more\napparent, because most of these issues were probably placed with\nindividual and inexpert investors. It was characteristic of these\nofferings that they did not make an adequate showing when\njudged by the performance of the companies over a sufficient num-\nber of years. They did look safe enough, for the most part, if it\ncould be assumed that the recent earnings would continue without\na serious setback. The investment bankers who brought out these\nissues presumably accepted this assumption, and their salesmen\nhad little difficulty in persuading themselves and their customers\nto a like effect. Nevertheless it was an unsound approach to invest-\nment, and one likely to prove costly.\nBull-market periods are usually characterized by the transfor-\nmation of a large number of privately owned businesses into com-\npanies with quoted shares. This was the case in 1945–46 and again\nbeginning in 1960. The process then reached extraordinary propor-\ntions until brought to a catastrophic close in May 1962. After the\nusual “swearing-off” period of several years the whole tragicom-\nedy was repeated, step by step, in 1967–1969.*\n*In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850 com-\npanies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average of more than\none per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again; in 1969 an aston-\nishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped create the bear\nmarkets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market was so dead that\nonly nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw only 14 stocks born.\nThat undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull market of the 1980s, when\nroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the market—helping to trigger the over-\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 141\nNew Common-Stock Offerings\nThe following paragraphs are reproduced unchanged from the\n1959 edition, with comment added:\nCommon-stock financing takes two different forms. In the case\nof companies already listed, additional shares are offered pro rata\nto the existing stockholders. The subscription price is set below\nthe current market, and the “rights” to subscribe have an initial\nmoney value.* The sale of the new shares is almost always under-\nwritten by one or more investment banking houses, but it is the\ngeneral hope and expectation that all the new shares will be taken\nby the exercise of the subscription rights. Thus the sale of addi-\ntional common stock of listed companies does not ordinarily call\nfor active selling effort on the part of distributing firms.\nThe second type is the placement with the public of common\nstock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. Most of\nthis stock is sold for the account of the controlling interests to\nenable them to cash in on a favorable market and to diversify their\nenthusiasm that led to the 1987 crash. Then the cycle swung the other way\nagain as IPOs dried up in 1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull\nmarket of the 1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the busi-\nness of creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the\nbubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual\ntotal since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs, has\nstayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for another scald-\ning. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors have gone through\nthis manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great IPO boom, back in 1825,\na man was said to have been squeezed to death in the stampede of specu-\nlators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of Southwark; the wealthiest buy-\ners hired thugs to punch their way to the front of the line. Sure enough, by\n1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of their value.\n*Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors who already\nown a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain the same\nproportional interest in the company. This form of financing, still widespread\nin Europe, has become rare in the United States, except among closed-end\nfunds.\nwww.fx1618.com142 The Intelligent Investor\nown finances. (When new money is raised for the business it\ncomes often via the sale of preferred stock, as previously noted.)\nThis activity follows a well-defined pattern, which by the nature of\nthe security markets must bring many losses and disappointments\nto the public. The dangers arise both from the character of the\nbusinesses that are thus financed and from the market conditions\nthat make the financing possible.\nIn the early part of the century a large proportion of our leading\ncompanies were introduced to public trading. As time went on, the\nnumber of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held\nsteadily diminished; hence original common-stock flotations have\ntended to be concentrated more and more on relatively small con-\ncerns. By an unfortunate correlation, during the same period the\nstock-buying public has been developing an ingrained preference\nfor the major companies and a similar prejudice against the minor\nones. This prejudice, like many others, tends to become weaker as\nbull markets are built up; the large and quick profits shown by\ncommon stocks as a whole are sufficient to dull the public’s critical\nfaculty, just as they sharpen its acquisitive instinct. During these\nperiods, also, quite a number of privately owned concerns can be\nfound that are enjoying excellent results—although most of these\nwould not present too impressive a record if the figures were car-\nried back, say, ten years or more.\nWhen these factors are put together the following consequences\nemerge: Somewhere in the middle of the bull market the first\ncommon-stock flotations make their appearance. These are priced\nnot unattractively, and some large profits are made by the buyers of\nthe early issues. As the market rise continues, this brand of financing\ngrows more frequent; the quality of the companies becomes steadily\npoorer; the prices asked and obtained verge on the exorbitant. One\nfairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the\nfact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies\nare offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for\nmany medium-sized companies with a long market history. (It\nshould be added that very little of this common-stock financing is\nordinarily done by banking houses of prime size and reputation.)*\n*In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally steered\nclear of twhew IPwO .bfxus1in6es1s,8 w.hcicoh mwas regarded as an undignified exploita-Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach 143\nThe heedlessness of the public and the willingness of selling\norganizations to sell whatever may be profitably sold can have\nonly one result—price collapse. In many cases the new issues lose\n75% and more of their offering price. The situation is worsened by\nthe aforementioned fact that, at bottom, the public has a real aver-\nsion to the very kind of small issue that it bought so readily in its\ncareless moments. Many of these issues fall, proportionately, as\nmuch below their true value as they formerly sold above it.\nAn elementary requirement for the intelligent investor is an abil-\nity to resist the blandishments of salesmen offering new common-\nstock issues during bull markets. Even if one or two can be found\nthat can pass severe tests of quality and value, it is probably bad pol-\nicy to get mixed up in this sort of business. Of course the salesman\nwill point to many such issues which have had good-sized market\nadvances—including some that go up spectacularly the very day\nthey are sold. But all this is part of the speculative atmosphere. It is\neasy money. For every dollar you make in this way you will be lucky\nif you end up by losing only two.\nSome of these issues may prove excellent buys—a few years\nlater, when nobody wants them and they can be had at a small\nfraction of their true worth.\nIn the 1965 edition we continued our discussion of this subject\nas follows:\nWhile the broader aspects of the stock market’s behavior since\n1949 have not lent themselves well to analysis based on long expe-\nrience, the development of new common-stock flotations pro-\nceeded exactly in accordance with ancient prescription. It is\ndoubtful whether we ever before had so many new issues offered,\nof such low quality, and with such extreme price collapses, as we\ntion of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late 1999 and early\n2000, however, Wall Street’s biggest investment banks had jumped in with\nboth feet. Venerable firms cast off their traditional prudence and behaved\nlike drunken mud wrestlers, scrambling to foist ludicrously overvalued\nstocks on a desperately eager public.

But we do know that an intelligent investor will not\nforget what happened in 1962 and will let others make the next\nbatch of quick profits in this area and experience the consequent\nharrowing losses.\nWe followed these paragraphs in the 1965 edition by citing “A\nHorrible Example,” namely, the sale of stock of Aetna Maintenance\nCo. at $9 in November 1961. In typical fashion the shares promptly\nadvanced to $15; the next year they fell to 23⁄, and in 1964 to 7⁄. The\n8 8\nlater history of this company was on the extraordinary side, and\nillustrates some of the strange metamorphoses that have taken\nplace in American business, great and small, in recent years. The\ncurious reader will find the older and newer history of this enter-\nprise in Appendix 5.\nIt is by no means difficult to provide even more harrowing\nexamples taken from the more recent version of “the same old\nstory,” which covered the years 1967–1970.

In his day, it was too costly and cumbersome for an indi-\nvidual investor to diversify away the risks of default.1(To learn how bad\na default can be, and how carelessly even “sophisticated” profes-\nsional bond investors can buy into one, see the sidebar on p. 146.)\nToday, however, more than 130 mutual funds specialize in junk bonds.\nThese funds buy junk by the cartload; they hold dozens of different\nbonds. That mitigates Graham’s complaints about the difficulty of\ndiversifying. (However, his bias against high-yield preferred stock\nremains valid, since there remains no cheap and widely available way\nto spread their risks.)\nSince 1978, an annual average of 4.4% of the junk-bond market\nhas gone into default—but, even after those defaults, junk bonds have\n1In the early 1970s, when Graham wrote, there were fewer than a dozen\njunk-bond funds, nearly all of which charged sales commissions of up to\n8.5%; some even made investors pay a fee for the privilege of reinvesting\ntheir monthly dividends back into the fund.\nwww.fx1618.com\n145146 Commentary on Chapter 6\nA WORLD OF HURT\nFOR WORLDCOM BONDS\nBuying a bond only for its yield is like getting married only for the\nsex. If the thing that attracted you in the first place dries up,\nyou’ll find yourself asking, “What else is there?” When the\nanswer is “Nothing,” spouses and bondholders alike end up with\nbroken hearts.\nOn May 9, 2001, WorldCom, Inc. sold the biggest offering\nof bonds in U.S. corporate history—$11.9 billion worth. Among\nthe eager beavers attracted by the yields of up to 8.3% were\nthe California Public Employees’ Retirement System, one of the\nworld’s largest pension funds; Retirement Systems of Alabama,\nwhose managers later explained that “the higher yields” were\n“very attractive to us at the time they were purchased”; and the\nStrong Corporate Bond Fund, whose comanager was so fond\nof WorldCom’s fat yield that he boasted, “we’re getting paid\nmore than enough extra income for the risk.”1\nBut even a 30-second glance at WorldCom’s bond prospec-\ntus would have shown that these bonds had nothing to offer but\ntheir yield—and everything to lose. In two of the previous five\nyears WorldCom’s pretax income (the company’s profits before\nit paid its dues to the IRS) fell short of covering its fixed charges\n(the costs of paying interest to its bondholders) by a stupen-\ndous $4.1 billion. WorldCom could cover those bond payments\nonly by borrowing more money from banks. And now, with this\nmountainous new helping of bonds, WorldCom was fattening\nits interest costs by another $900 million per year!2 Like Mr.\nCreosote in Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life, WorldCom\nwas gorging itself to the bursting point.\nNo yield could ever be high enough to compensate an investor\nfor risking that kind of explosion.

If you work at a bank or other\nfinancial company, a sharp rise in interest rates could limit your raise or\neven threaten your job security—so a junk fund, which tends to outper-\nform most other bond funds when interest rates rise, might make\nsense as a counterweight in your 401(k). A junk-bond fund, though, is\nonly a minor option—not an obligation—for the intelligent investor.\n2Edward I.

Roughly a dozen mutual\nfunds specialize in bonds issued in emerging-market nations (or what\nused to be called “Third World countries”) like Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria,\nRussia, and Venezuela. No sane investor would put more than 10% of\na total bond portfolio in spicy holdings like these. But emerging-\nmarkets bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock market,\nso they are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop merely\nbecause the Dow is down. That can give you a small corner of comfort\nin your portfolio just when you may need it most.4\nDYING A TRADER’S DEATH\nAs we’ve already seen in Chapter 1, day trading—holding stocks for a\nfew hours at a time—is one of the best weapons ever invented for com-\nmitting financial suicide. Some of your trades might make money, most\nof your trades will lose money, but your broker will always make\nmoney.\nAnd your own eagerness to buy or sell a stock can lower your\nreturn. Someone who is desperate to buy a stock can easily end up\nhaving to bid 10 cents higher than the most recent share price before\nany sellers will be willing to part with it.

On the flip side, when panicky investors are frantic to sell a stock\nand they dump it for less than the most recent price, market impact\nhits home again.\nThe costs of trading wear away your returns like so many swipes of\nsandpaper. Buying or selling a hot little stock can cost 2% to 4% (or\n4% to 8% for a “round-trip” buy-and-sell transaction).5 If you put\n$1,000 into a stock, your trading costs could eat up roughly $40\nbefore you even get started. Sell the stock, and you could fork over\nanother 4% in trading expenses.\nOh, yes—there’s one other thing. When you trade instead of invest,\nyou turn long-term gains (taxed at a maximum capital-gains rate of\n20%) into ordinary income (taxed at a maximum rate of 38.6%).\nAdd it all up, and a stock trader needs to gain at least 10% just to\nbreak even on buying and selling a stock.6 Anyone can do that once,\nby luck alone.

The most patient investors,\nhowever—who traded a minuscule 0.2% of their total holdings in\nan average month—managed to outperform the market by a whisker,\neven after their trading costs. Instead of giving a huge hunk of their\ngains away to their brokers and the IRS, they got to keep almost\neverything.7For a look at these results, see Figure 6-1.\nThe lesson is clear: Don’t just do something, stand there.

An IPO is an “initial public offering,”\nor the first sale of a company’s stock to the public. At first blush,\ninvesting in IPOs sounds like a great idea—after all, if you’d bought\n100 shares of Microsoft when it went public on March 13, 1986, your\n$2,100 investment would have grown to $720,000 by early 2003.8\nAnd finance professors Jay Ritter and William Schwert have shown\nthat if you had spread a total of only $1,000 across every IPO in Janu-\nary 1960, at its offering price, sold out at the end of that month,\nthen invested anew in each successive month’s crop of IPOs, your\nportfolio would have been worth more than $533 decillion by year-\nend 2001.\n(On the printed page, that looks like this:\n$533,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.)\n7Barber and Odean’s findings are available at http://faculty.haas.berkeley.\nedu/odean/Current%20Research.htm and http://faculty.gsm.ucdavis.edu/\n~bmbarber/research/default.html.

Finally, most of the high returns on IPOs are captured\nby members of an exclusive private club—the big investment banks\nand fund houses that get shares at the initial (or “underwriting”) price,\nbefore the stock begins public trading. The biggest “run-ups” often\noccur in stocks so small that even many big investors can’t get any\nshares; there just aren’t enough to go around.\nIf, like nearly every investor, you can get access to IPOs only after\ntheir shares have rocketed above the exclusive initial price, your\nresults will be terrible.

In our discussion of general investment\npolicy we have made some suggestions regarding bond investments\nthat are addressed chiefly to the enterprising investor. He might be\ninterested in special opportunities of the following kinds:\n(1) Tax-free New Housing Authority bonds effectively guaranteed\nby the United States government.\n(2) Taxable but high-yielding New Community bonds, also guar-\nanteed by the United States government.\n(3) Tax-free industrial bonds issued by municipalities, but ser-\nviced by lease payments made by strong corporations.\nReferences have been made to these unusual types of bond\nissues in Chapter 4.*\nAt the other end of the spectrum there may be lower-quality\nbonds obtainable at such low prices as to constitute true bargain\nopportunities.

Buying in low markets and selling in high markets\n2. Buying carefully chosen “growth stocks”\n3. Buying bargain issues of various types\n4. Buying into “special situations”\nGeneral Market Policy—Formula Timing\nWe reserve for the next chapter our discussion of the possibili-\nties and limitations of a policy of entering the market when it is\ndepressed and selling out in the advanced stages of a boom. For\nmany years in the past this bright idea appeared both simple and\nfeasible, at least from first inspection of a market chart covering its\nperiodic fluctuations. We have already admitted ruefully that the\nmarket’s action in the past 20 years has not lent itself to operations\nof this sort on any mathematical basis. The fluctuations that have\ntaken place, while not inconsiderable in extent, would have\nrequired a special talent or “feel” for trading to take advantage of\nthem. This is something quite different from the intelligence which\nwe are assuming in our readers, and we must exclude operations\nbased on such skill from our terms of reference.\nThe 50–50 plan, which we proposed to the defensive investor\nand described on p. 90, is about the best specific or automatic for-\nmula we can recommend to all investors under the conditions of\n1972. But we have retained a broad leeway between the 25% mini-\napproaching) bankruptcy, its common stock becomes essentially worthless,\nsince U.S. bankruptcy law entitles bondholders to a much stronger legal\nclaim than shareholders. But if the company reorganizes successfully and\ncomes out of bankruptcy, the bondholders often receive stock in the new\nfirm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is able\nto pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can perform\nalmost as well as the common stock of a healthy company. In these special\nsituations, as Graham puts it, “no true distinction exists between bonds and\ncommon stocks.”\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 157\nmum and the 75% maximum in common stocks, which we allow to\nthose investors who have strong convictions about either the dan-\nger or the attractiveness of the general market level. Some 20 years\nago it was possible to discuss in great detail a number of clear-cut\nformulas for varying the percentage held in common stocks, with\nconfidence that these plans had practical utility.1The times seem to\nhave passed such approaches by, and there would be little point in\ntrying to determine new levels for buying and selling out of the\nmarket patterns since 1949. That is too short a period to furnish any\nreliable guide to the future.*\nGrowth-Stock Approach\nEvery investor would like to select the stocks of companies that\nwill do better than the average over a period of years. A growth\nstock may be defined as one that has done this in the past and\nis expected to do so in the future.2 Thus it seems only logical that\nthe intelligent investor should concentrate upon the selection of\ngrowth stocks. Actually the matter is more complicated, as we shall\ntry to show.\nIt is a mere statistical chore to identify companies that have “out-\nperformed the averages” in the past. The investor can obtain a list of\n50 or 100 such enterprises from his broker.† Why, then, should he\nnot merely pick out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of this\ngroup and lo! he has a guaranteed-successful stock portfolio?\n*Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he con-\ntends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is too\nshort a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his mastery of\nmathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions require very\nlong samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who peddle “time-\ntested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their findings on smaller\nsamples than Graham would ever accept. (Graham often used 50-year peri-\nods to analyze past data.)\n†Today, the enterprising investor can assemble such a list over the Internet\nby visiting such websites as www.morningstar.com (try the Stock Quickrank\ntool), www.quicken.com/investments/stocks/search/full, and http://yahoo.\nmarketguide.com.\nwww.fx1618.com158 The Intelligent Investor\nThere are two catches to this simple idea. The first is that com-\nmon stocks with good records and apparently good prospects sell\nat correspondingly high prices. The investor may be right in his\njudgment of their prospects and still not fare particularly well,\nmerely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the\nexpected prosperity. The second is that his judgment as to the\nfuture may prove wrong. Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up\nforever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expan-\nsion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement\nmore difficult. At some point the growth curve flattens out, and in\nmany cases it turns downward.\nIt is obvious that if one confines himself to a few chosen\ninstances, based on hindsight, he could demonstrate that fortunes\ncan readily be either made or lost in the growth-stock field. How\ncan one judge fairly of the overall results obtainable here? We think\nthat reasonably sound conclusions can be drawn from a study of\nthe results achieved by the investment funds specializing in the\ngrowth-stock approach. The authoritative manual entitled Invest-\nment Companies, published annually by Arthur Wiesenberger &\nCompany, members of the New York Stock Exchange, computes\nthe annual performance of some 120 such “growth funds” over a\nperiod of years. Of these, 45 have records covering ten years or\nmore. The average overall gain for these companies—unweighted\nfor size of fund—works out at 108% for the decade 1961–1970,\ncompared with 105% for the S & P composite and 83% for the\nDJIA.3 In the two years 1969 and 1970 the majority of the 126\n“growth funds” did worse than either index. Similar results were\nfound in our earlier studies. The implication here is that no out-\nstanding rewards came from diversified investment in growth\ncompanies as compared with that in common stocks generally.*\n*Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in large\ngrowth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth\nfunds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall\nstock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,\n“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies also\nunderperformed the market over the same period (by a full percentage point\nper year). Is the problem merely that growth funds cannot reliably select\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 159\nThere is no reason at all for thinking that the average intelligent\ninvestor, even with much devoted effort, can derive better results\nover the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the invest-\nment companies specializing in this area. Surely these organiza-\ntions have more brains and better research facilities at their\ndisposal than you do. Consequently we should advise against the\nusual type of growth-stock commitment for the enterprising\ninvestor.* This is one in which the excellent prospects are fully rec-\nognized in the market and already reflected in a current price-\nearnings ratio of, say, higher than 20. (For the defensive investor\nwe suggested an upper limit of purchase price at 25 times average\nearnings of the past seven years. The two criteria would be about\nequivalent in most cases.)†\nstocks that will outperform the market in the future? Or is it that the high\ncosts of running the average fund (whether it buys growth or “value” compa-\nnies) exceed any extra return the managers can earn with their stock picks?\nToupdate fund performance by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category\nReturns.” For an enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of\ndifferent investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_\ntable/pertable.pdf.\n*Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising” investor is\nnot one who takes more risk than average or who buys “aggressive growth”\nstocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who is willing to put in extra\ntime and effort in researching his or her portfolio.\n†Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio based\non a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the odds that\nyou will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily high burst\nof profitability. Imagine that a company earned $3 per share over the past\n12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over the previous six\nyears. Which number—the sudden $3 or the steady 50 cents—is more likely\nto represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the $3 it earned in the most\nrecent year, the stock would be priced at $75. But at 25 times the average\nearnings of the past seven years ($6 in total earnings, divided by seven,\nequals 85.7 cents per share in average annual earnings), the stock would\nbe priced at only $21.43. Which number you pick makes a big difference.\nFinally, it’s worth noting that the prevailing method on Wall Street today—\nbasing price/earnings ratios primarily on “next year’s earnings”—would be\nwww.fx1618.com160 The Intelligent Investor\nThe striking thing about growth stocks as a class is their ten-\ndency toward wide swings in market price. This is true of the\nlargest and longest-established companies—such as General Elec-\ntric and International Business Machines—and even more so of\nnewer and smaller successful companies. They illustrate our thesis\nthat the main characteristic of the stock market since 1949 has been\nthe injection of a highly speculative element into the shares of com-\npanies which have scored the most brilliant successes, and which\nthemselves would be entitled to a high investment rating. (Their\ncredit standing is of the best, and they pay the lowest interest rates\non their borrowings.) The investment caliber of such a company\nmay not change over a long span of years, but the risk characteris-\ntics of its stockwill depend on what happens to it in the stock mar-\nket. The more enthusiastic the public grows about it, and the faster\nits advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the\nriskier a proposition it becomes.*\nBut is it not true, the reader may ask, that the really big fortunes\nfrom common stocks have been garnered by those who made a\nsubstantial commitment in the early years of a company in whose\nfuture they had great confidence, and who held their original\nshares unwaveringly while they increased 100-fold or more in\nvalue? The answer is “Yes.” But the big fortunes from single-\ncompany investments are almost always realized by persons who\nanathema to Graham. How can you value a company based on earnings it\nhasn’t even generated yet? That’s like setting house prices based on a\nrumor that Cinderella will be building her new castle right around the corner.\n*Recent examples hammer Graham’s point home. On September 21,\n2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it expected\nits revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first blush, that\nsounds great; most big companies would be delighted to increase their\nsales by 5% in just three months. But in response, Intel’s stock dropped\n22%, a one-day loss of nearly $91 billion in total value. Why? Wall Street’s\nanalysts had expected Intel’s revenue to rise by up to 10%. Similarly, on\nFebruary 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage firm, announced that it\nexpected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in 2001—but that a new cau-\ntion among customers “may lead to longer selling cycles.” On that whiff of\nhesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their value in a single day.\nwww.fx1618.coma0791–1691\n”,sdnuF\nhtworG“\nfo\nstluseR\negarevA\n1-7\nELBAT\n0791\ndnediviD\nsraey\n01\nsraey\n5\nraey\n1\nnruteR\n0791–1691\n0791–6691\n0791\n%3.2\n%1.121+\n%2.32+\n%5.7\n–\nsdnuf\nhtworg\negral\n71\n6.1\n1.201+\n3.02+\n7.71–\nA\npuorg—sdnuf\nhtworg\nrellams\n601\n4.1\n7.601+\n2.32+\n7.4\n–\nB\npuorg—sdnuf\nhtworg\nrellams\n83\n7.1\n4.79\n+\n8.31+\n2.41–\neman\nrieht\nni\n”htworg“\nhtiw\nsdnuf\n51\n4.3\n7.401+\n1.61+\n%5.3\n+\netisopmoc\ns’rooP\n&\ndradnatS\n7.3\n0.38\n+\n9.2\n+\n7.8\n+\negarevA\nlairtsudnI\nsenoJ\nwoD\n.secivreS\nlaicnaniF\nregrebneseiW\nyb\ndeilppus\nera\nserugif\nesehTa\nwww.fx1618.com162 The Intelligent Investor\nhave a close relationship with the particular company—through\nemployment, family connection, etc.—which justifies them in plac-\ning a large part of their resources in one medium and holding on\nto this commitment through all vicissitudes, despite numerous\ntemptations to sell out at apparently high prices along the way.\nAn investor without such close personal contact will constantly\nbe faced with the question of whether too large a portion of\nhis funds are in this one medium.* Each decline—however tempo-\nrary it proves in the sequel—will accentuate his problem; and\ninternal and external pressures are likely to force him to take what\nseems to be a goodly profit, but one far less than the ultimate\nbonanza.4\nThree Recommended Fields for “Enterprising Investment”\nToobtain better than average investment results over a long pull\nrequires a policy of selection or operation possessing a twofold\nmerit: (1) It must meet objective or rational tests of underlying\nsoundness; and (2) it must be different from the policy followed by\nmost investors or speculators. Our experience and study leads us\nto recommend three investment approaches that meet these crite-\nria. They differ rather widely from one another, and each may\nrequire a different type of knowledge and temperament on the part\nof those who assay it.\n*Today’s equivalent of investors “who have a close relationship with the par-\nticular company” are so-called control persons—senior managers or direc-\ntors who help run the company and own huge blocks of stock. Executives\nlike Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway have\ndirect control over a company’s destiny—and outside investors want to see\nthese chief executives maintain their large shareholdings as a vote of confi-\ndence. But less-senior managers and rank-and-file workers cannot influence\nthe company’s share price with their individual decisions; thus they should\nnot put more than a small percentage of their assets in their own employer’s\nstock. As for outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the\ncompany, the same objection applies.\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 163\nThe Relatively Unpopular Large Company\nIf we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue com-\nmon stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are\nglamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will\nundervalue—relatively, at least—companies that are out of favor\nbecause of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature.\nThis may be set down as a fundamental law of the stock market,\nand it suggests an investment approach that should prove both\nconservative and promising.\nThe key requirement here is that the enterprising investor\nconcentrate on the larger companies that are going through a\nperiod of unpopularity. While small companies may also be\nundervalued for similar reasons, and in many cases may later\nincrease their earnings and share price, they entail the risk of a\ndefinitive loss of profitability and also of protracted neglect by\nthe market in spite of better earnings. The large companies thus\nhave a double advantage over the others. First, they have the\nresources in capital and brain power to carry them through adver-\nsity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the market is\nlikely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement\nshown.\nA remarkable demonstration of the soundness of this thesis is\nfound in studies of the price behavior of the unpopular issues in\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average. In these it was assumed that an\ninvestment was made each year in either the six or the ten issues\nin the DJIA which were selling at the lowest multipliers of their\ncurrent or previous year’s earnings. These could be called the\n“cheapest” stocks in the list, and their cheapness was evidently the\nreflection of relative unpopularity with investors or traders. It was\nassumed further that these purchases were sold out at the end of\nholding periods ranging from one to five years. The results of these\ninvestments were then compared with the results shown in either\nthe DJIAas a whole or in the highest multiplier (i.e., the most pop-\nular) group.\nThe detailed material we have available covers the results of\nannual purchases assumed in each of the past 53 years.5In the early\nperiod, 1917–1933, this approach proved unprofitable. But since\n1933 the method has shown highly successful results.

The consistently better performance of the\nlow-multiplier stocks is shown (Table 7-2) by the average results\nfor successive five-year periods, when compared with those of the\nDJIAand of the ten high-multipliers.\nThe Drexel computation shows further that an original invest-\nment of $10,000 made in the low-multiplier issues in 1936, and\nswitched each year in accordance with the principle, would have\ngrown to $66,900 by 1962. The same operations in high-multiplier\nstocks would have ended with a value of only $25,300; while an\noperation in all thirty stocks would have increased the original\nfund to $44,000.†\nThe concept of buying “unpopular large companies” and its\n*Drexel Firestone, a Philadelphia investment bank, merged in 1973 with\nBurnham & Co. and later became Drexel Burnham Lambert, famous for its\njunk-bond financing of the 1980s takeover boom.\n†This strategy of buying the cheapest stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage is now nicknamed the “Dogs of the Dow” approach.

But in considering individual companies a special factor of\nopposite import must sometimes to be taken into account. Compa-\nnies that are inherently speculative because of widely varying\nearnings tend to sell both at a relatively high price and at a rela-\ntively low multiplier in their good years, and conversely at low\nprices and high multipliers in their bad years. These relationships\nare illustrated in Table 7-3, covering fluctuations of Chrysler Corp.\ncommon. In these cases the market has sufficient skepticism as to\nthe continuation of the unusually high profits to value them con-\nservatively, and conversely when earnings are low or nonexistent.\n(Note that, by the arithmetic, if a company earns “next to nothing”\nits shares must sell at a high multiplier of these minuscule profits.)\nAs it happens Chrysler has been quite exceptional in the DJIA\nlist of leading companies, and hence it did not greatly affect the the\nlow-multiplier calculations. It would be quite easy to avoid inclu-\nsion of such anomalous issues in a low-multiplier list by requiring\nalso that the price be low in relation to past averageearnings or by\nsome similar test.\nWhile writing this revision we tested the results of the DJIA-\nlow-multiplier method applied to a group assumed to be bought at\nTABLE 7-3 Chrysler Common Prices and Earnings, 1952–1970\nYear Earnings Per Share High or Low Price P/E Ratio\n1952 $ 9.04 H 98 10.8\n1954 2.13 L 56 26.2\n1955 11.49 H 1011⁄ 8.8\n2\n1956 2.29 L 52 (in 1957) 22.9\n1957 13.75 H 82 6.7\n1958 (def.) 3.88 L 44a —\n1968 24.92b H 294b 11.8\n1970 def.

Perhaps the aggressive investor should start with\nthe “low-multiplier” idea, but add other quantitative and qualita-\ntive requirements thereto in making up his portfolio.\nPurchase of Bargain Issues\nWe define a bargain issue as one which, on the basis of facts\nestablished by analysis, appears to be worth considerably more\nthan it is selling for. The genus includes bonds and preferred stocks\nselling well under par, as well as common stocks. To be as concrete\nas possible, let us suggest that an issue is not a true “bargain”\nunless the indicated value is at least 50% more than the price. What\nkind of facts would warrant the conclusion that so great a discrep-\nancy exists? How do bargains come into existence, and how does\nthe investor profit from them?\nThere are two tests by which a bargain common stock is\ndetected. The first is by the method of appraisal. This relies largely\non estimating future earnings and then multiplying these by a fac-\ntor appropriate to the particular issue. If the resultant value is suffi-\nciently above the market price—and if the investor has confidence\nin the technique employed—he can tag the stock as a bargain. The\nsecond test is the value of the business to a private owner. This\nvalue also is often determined chiefly by expected future earn-\nings—in which case the result may be identical with the first. But in\nthe second test more attention is likely to be paid to the realizable\nvalue of the assets, with particular emphasis on the net current\nassets or working capital.\nAt low points in the general market a large proportion of com-\nmon stocks are bargain issues, as measured by these standards. (A\ntypical example was General Motors when it sold at less than 30 in\n1941, equivalent to only 5 for the 1971 shares. It had been earning\nin excess of $4 and paying $3.50, or more, in dividends.) It is true\nthat current earnings and the immediate prospects may both be\npoor, but a levelheaded appraisal of average future conditions\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 167\nwould indicate values far above ruling prices. Thus the wisdom of\nhaving courage in depressed markets is vindicated not only by the\nvoice of experience but also by application of plausible techniques\nof value analysis.\nThe same vagaries of the market place that recurrently establish\na bargain condition in the general list account for the existence of\nmany individual bargains at almost all market levels. The market is\nfond of making mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordi-\nnary vicissitudes into major setbacks.* Even a mere lack of interest\nor enthusiasm may impel a price decline to absurdly low levels.\nThus we have what appear to be two major sources of undervalua-\ntion: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect\nor unpopularity.\nHowever, neither of these causes, if considered by itself alone,\ncan be relied on as a guide to successful common-stock investment.\nHow can we be sure that the currently disappointing results are\nindeed going to be only temporary? True, we can supply excellent\nexamples of that happening. The steel stocks used to be famous\nfor their cyclical quality, and the shrewd buyer could acquire\nthem at low prices when earnings were low and sell them out in\nboom years at a fine profit. Aspectacular example is supplied by\nChrysler Corporation, as shown by the data in Table 7-3.\nIf this were the standard behavior of stocks with fluctuating\nearnings, then making profits in the stock market would be an easy\nmatter. Unfortunately, we could cite many examples of declines in\n*Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of molehills:\nIn May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\nannounced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence drug Viagra had died\nof heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock immediately went flaccid,\nlosing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading. But Pfizer’s shares surged\nahead when research later showed that there was no cause for alarm; the\nstock gained roughly a third over the next two years. In late 1997, shares of\nWarner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a day when sales of its new diabetes\ndrug were temporarily halted in England; within six months, the stock had\nnearly doubled. In late 2002, Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships,\nlost roughly 10% of its value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea\nand vomiting—on ships run by other companies.\nwww.fx1618.com168 The Intelligent Investor\nearnings and price which were not followed automatically by a\nhandsome recovery of both. One such was Anaconda Wire and\nCable, which had large earnings up to 1956, with a high price of 85\nin that year. The earnings then declined irregularly for six years;\nthe price fell to 231⁄ in 1962, and the following year it was taken\n2\nover by its parent enterprise (Anaconda Corporation) at the equiv-\nalent of only 33.\nThe many experiences of this type suggest that the investor\nwould need more than a mere falling off in both earnings and price\nto give him a sound basis for purchase. He should require an indi-\ncation of at least reasonable stability of earnings over the past\ndecade or more—i.e., no year of earnings deficit—plus sufficient\nsize and financial strength to meet possible setbacks in the future.\nThe ideal combination here is thus that of a large and prominent\ncompany selling both well below its past average price and its past\naverage price/earnings multiplier. This would no doubt have\nruled out most of the profitable opportunities in companies such as\nChrysler, since their low-price years are generally accompanied by\nhigh price/earnings ratios. But let us assure the reader now—and\nno doubt we shall do it again—that there is a world of difference\nbetween “hindsight profits” and “real-money profits.” We doubt\nseriously whether the Chrysler type of roller coaster is a suitable\nmedium for operations by our enterprising investor.\nWehave mentioned protracted neglect or unpopularity as a sec-\nond cause of price declines to unduly low levels. Acurrent case of\nthis kind would appear to be National Presto Industries. In the bull\nmarket of 1968 it sold at a high of 45, which was only 8 times the\n$5.61 earnings for that year. The per-share profits increased in both\n1969 and 1970, but the price declined to only 21 in 1970. This was\nless than 4 times the (record) earnings in that year and less than its\nnet-current-asset value. In March 1972 it was selling at 34, still only\n51⁄ times the last reported earnings, and at about its enlarged net-\n2\ncurrent-asset value.\nAnother example of this type is provided currently by Standard\nOil of California, a concern of major importance. In early 1972 it\nwas selling at about the same price as 13 years before, say 56. Its\nearnings had been remarkably steady, with relatively small growth\nbut with only one small decline over the entire period. Its book\nvalue was about equal to the market price. With this conservatively\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 169\nfavorable 1958–71 record the company has never shown an aver-\nage annual price as high as 15 times its current earnings. In early\n1972 the price/earnings ratio was only about 10.\nAthird cause for an unduly low price for a common stock may\nbe the market’s failure to recognize its true earnings picture. Our\nclassic example here is Northern Pacific Railway which in 1946–47\ndeclined from 36 to 131⁄. The true earnings of the road in 1947 were\n2\nclose to $10 per share. The price of the stock was held down in\ngreat part by its $1 dividend. It was neglected also because much of\nits earnings power was concealed by accounting methods peculiar\nto railroads.\nThe type of bargain issue that can be most readily identified is a\ncommon stock that sells for less than the company’s net working\ncapital alone, after deducting all prior obligations.* This would\nmean that the buyer would pay nothing at all for the fixed assets—\nbuildings, machinery, etc., or any good-will items that might exist.\nVery few companies turn out to have an ultimate value less than\nthe working capital alone, although scattered instances may be\nfound. The surprising thing, rather, is that there have been so many\nenterprises obtainable which have been valued in the market on\nthis bargain basis. Acompilation made in 1957, when the market’s\nlevel was by no means low, disclosed about 150 of such common\nstocks. In Table 7-4 we summarize the result of buying, on Decem-\nber 31, 1957, one share of each of the 85 companies in that list for\nwhich data appeared in Standard & Poor’s Monthly Stock Guide,\nand holding them for two years.\nBy something of a coincidence, each of the groups advanced in\nthe two years to somewhere in the neighborhood of the aggregate\nnet-current-asset value. The gain for the entire “portfolio” in that\nperiod was 75%, against 50% for Standard & Poor’s 425 industrials.\nWhat is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed signifi-\ncant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable\ngains.\nOur experience with this type of investment selection—on a\n*By “net working capital,” Graham means a company’s current assets (such\nas cash, marketable securities, and inventories) minus its total liabilities\n(including preferred stock and long-term debt).\nwww.fx1618.com170 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 7-4 Profit Experience of Undervalued Stocks,\n1957–1959\nAggregateNet Aggregate Aggregate\nLocation of Number of Current Assets Price Price\nMarket Companies Per Share Dec. 1957 Dec. 1959\nNew York S.E. 35 $ 748 $ 419 $ 838\nAmerican S.E. 25 495 289 492\nMidwest S.E. 5 163 87 141\nOver the counter 20 425 288 433\nTotal 85 $1,831 $1,083 $1,904\ndiversified basis—was uniformly good for many years prior to\n1957.

However, during the general\nmarket advance after 1957 the number of such opportunities\nbecame extremely limited, and many of those available were show-\ning small operating profits or even losses. The market decline of\n1969–70 produced a new crop of these “sub-working-capital”\nstocks. We discuss this group in Chapter 15, on stock selection for\nthe enterprising investor.\nBargain-Issue Pattern in Secondary Companies. We have\ndefined a secondary company as one that is not a leader in a fairly\nimportant industry. Thus it is usually one of the smaller concerns\nin its field, but it may equally well be the chief unit in an unimpor-\ntant line. By way of exception, any company that has established\nitself as a growth stock is not ordinarily considered “secondary.”\nIn the great bull market of the 1920s relatively little distinction\nwas drawn between industry leaders and other listed issues, pro-\nvided the latter were of respectable size. The public felt that a\nmiddle-sized company was strong enough to weather storms and\nthat it had a better chance for really spectacular expansion than one\nthat was already of major dimensions. The depression years\n1931–32, however, had a particularly devastating impact on the\ncompanies below the first rank either in size or in inherent stability.\nAs a result of that experience investors have since developed a pro-\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 171\nnounced preference for industry leaders and a corresponding lack\nof interest most of the time in the ordinary company of secondary\nimportance. This has meant that the latter group have usually sold\nat much lower prices in relation to earnings and assets than have\nthe former. It has meant further that in many instances the price\nhas fallen so low as to establish the issue in the bargain class.\nWhen investors rejected the stocks of secondary companies,\neven though these sold at relatively low prices, they were express-\ning a belief or fear that such companies faced a dismal future. In\nfact, at least subconsciously, they calculated that anyprice was too\nhigh for them because they were heading for extinction—just as in\n1929 the companion theory for the “blue chips” was that no price\nwas too high for them because their future possibilities were limit-\nless. Both of these views were exaggerations and were productive\nof serious investment errors. Actually, the typical middle-sized\nlisted company is a large one when compared with the average pri-\nvately owned business. There is no sound reason why such compa-\nnies should not continue indefinitely in operation, undergoing the\nvicissitudes characteristic of our economy but earning on the\nwhole a fair return on their invested capital.\nThis brief review indicates that the stock market’s attitude\ntoward secondary companies tends to be unrealistic and conse-\nquently to create in normal times innumerable instances of major\nundervaluation. As it happens, the World War II period and the\npostwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns than to\nthe larger ones, because then the normal competition for sales was\nsuspended and the former could expand sales and profit margins\nmore spectacularly. Thus by 1946 the market’s pattern had com-\npletely reversed itself from that before the war. Whereas the lead-\ning stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had advanced only\n40% from the end of 1938 to the 1946 high, Standard & Poor’s index\nof low-priced stocks had shot up no less than 280% in the same\nperiod. Speculators and many self-styled investors—with the\nproverbial short memories of people in the stock market—were\neager to buy both old and new issues of unimportant companies at\ninflated levels. Thus the pendulum had swung clear to the oppo-\nsite extreme. The very class of secondary issues that had formerly\nsupplied by far the largest proportion of bargain opportunities was\nnow presenting the greatest number of examples of overenthusi-\nwww.fx1618.com172 The Intelligent Investor\nasm and overvaluation. In a different way this phenomenon was\nrepeated in 1961 and 1968—the emphasis now being placed on\nnew offerings of the shares of small companies of less than second-\nary character, and on nearly all companies in certain favored fields\nsuch as “electronics,” “computers,” “franchise” concerns, and oth-\ners.*\nAs was to be expected the ensuing market declines fell most\nheavily on these overvaluations. In some cases the pendulum\nswing may have gone as far as definite undervaluation.\nIf most secondary issues tend normally to be undervalued, what\nreason has the investor to believe that he can profit from such a sit-\nuation? For if it persists indefinitely, will he not always be in the\nsame market position as when he bought the issue? The answer\nhere is somewhat complicated. Substantial profits from the pur-\nchase of secondary companies at bargain prices arise in a variety of\nways. First, the dividend return is relatively high. Second, the rein-\nvested earnings are substantial in relation to the price paid and will\nultimately affect the price. In a five- to seven-year period these\nadvantages can bulk quite large in a well-selected list. Third, a bull\nmarket is ordinarily most generous to low-priced issues; thus it\ntends to raise the typical bargain issue to at least a reasonable level.\nFourth, even during relatively featureless market periods a contin-\nuous process of price adjustment goes on, under which secondary\nissues that were undervalued may rise at least to the normal level\nfor their type of security. Fifth, the specific factors that in many\n*From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed large\nstocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year. The\ninvesting public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund companies\nrolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and small stocks\nobliged by underperforminglarge stocks by five percentage points per year\nover the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when small stocks beat\nbig stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring investment bankers to\nsell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to the public for the first time.\nInstead of “electronics,” “computers,” or “franchise” in their names, the new\nbuzzwords were “.com,” “optical,” “wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and\n“I-.” Investing buzzwords always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone\nwho believes in them.\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 173\ncases made for a disappointing record of earnings may be cor-\nrected by the advent of new conditions, or the adoption of new\npolicies, or by a change in management.\nAn important new factor in recent years has been the acquisition\nof smaller companies by larger ones, usually as part of a diversifi-\ncation program. In these cases the consideration paid has almost\nalways been relatively generous, and much in excess of the bargain\nlevels existing not long before.\nWhen interest rates were much lower than in 1970, the field of\nbargain issues extended to bonds and preferred stocks that sold at\nlarge discounts from the amount of their claim. Currently we have\na different situation in which even well-secured issues sell at large\ndiscounts if carrying coupon rates of, say, 41⁄% or less. Example:\n2\nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph 25⁄s, due 1986, sold as low as 51\n8\nin 1970; Deere & Co. 41⁄s, due 1983, sold as low as 62. These may\n2\nwell turn out to have been bargain opportunities before very\nlong—if ruling interest rates should decline substantially. For a\nbargain bond issue in the more traditional sense perhaps we shall\nhave to turn once more to the first-mortgage bonds of railroads\nnow in financial difficulties, which sell in the 20s or 30s. Such situa-\ntions are not for the inexpert investor; lacking a real sense of values\nin this area, he may burn his fingers. But there is an underlying ten-\ndency for market decline in this field to be overdone; consequently\nthe group as a whole offers an especially rewarding invitation to\ncareful and courageous analysis. In the decade ending in 1948 the\nbillion-dollar group of defaulted railroad bonds presented numer-\nous and spectacular opportunities in this area. Such opportunities\nhave been quite scarce since then; but they seem likely to return in\nthe 1970s.*\n*Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities today. How-\never, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds, as well as con-\nvertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer real value in the\nwake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But diversification in this area is\nessential—and impractical without at least $100,000 to dedicate to dis-\ntressed securities alone. Unless you are a millionaire several times over, this\nkind of diversification is not an option.\nwww.fx1618.com174 The Intelligent Investor\nSpecial Situations, or “Workouts”\nNot so long ago this was a field which could almost guarantee\nan attractive rate of return to those who knew their way around in\nit; and this was true under almost any sort of general market situa-\ntion. It was not actually forbidden territory to members of the gen-\neral public. Some who had a flair for this sort of thing could learn\nthe ropes and become pretty capable practitioners without the\nnecessity of long academic study or apprenticeship. Others have\nbeen keen enough to recognize the underlying soundness of this\napproach and to attach themselves to bright young men who\nhandled funds devoted chiefly to these “special situations.” But\nin recent years, for reasons we shall develop later, the field of “arbi-\ntrages and workouts” became riskier and less profitable. It may\nbe that in years to come conditions in this field will become more\npropitious. In any case it is worthwhile outlining the general\nnature and origin of these operations, with one or two illustrative\nexamples.\nThe typical “special situation” has grown out of the increasing\nnumber of acquisitions of smaller firms by large ones, as the gospel\nof diversification of products has been adopted by more and more\nmanagements. It often appears good business for such an enter-\nprise to acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter\nrather than to start a new venture from scratch. In order to make\nsuch acquisition possible, and to obtain acceptance of the deal by\nthe required large majority of shareholders of the smaller company,\nit is almost always necessary to offer a price considerably above\nthe current level. Such corporate moves have been producing inter-\nesting profit-making opportunities for those who have made a\nstudy of this field, and have good judgment fortified by ample\nexperience.\nA great deal of money was made by shrewd investors not so\nmany years ago through the purchase of bonds of railroads in\nbankruptcy—bonds which they knew would be worth much more\nthan their cost when the railroads were finally reorganized. After\npromulgation of the plans of reorganization a “when issued” mar-\nket for the new securities appeared. These could almost always be\nsold for considerably more than the cost of the old issues which\nwere to be exchanged therefor. There were risks of nonconsumma-\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 175\ntion of the plans or of unexpected delays, but on the whole such\n“arbitrage operations” proved highly profitable.\nThere were similar opportunities growing out of the breakup of\npublic-utility holding companies pursuant to 1935 legislation.\nNearly all these enterprises proved to be worth considerably more\nwhen changed from holding companies to a group of separate\noperating companies.\nThe underlying factor here is the tendency of the security mar-\nkets to undervalue issues that are involved in any sort of compli-\ncated legal proceedings. An old Wall Street motto has been: “Never\nbuy into a lawsuit.” This may be sound advice to the speculator\nseeking quick action on his holdings. But the adoption of this atti-\ntude by the general public is bound to create bargain opportunities\nin the securities affected by it, since the prejudice against them\nholds their prices down to unduly low levels.*\nThe exploitation of special situations is a technical branch of\ninvestment which requires a somewhat unusual mentality and\nequipment. Probably only a small percentage of our enterprising\ninvestors are likely to engage in it, and this book is not the appro-\npriate medium for expounding its complications.6\nBroader Implications of Our Rules for Investment\nInvestment policy, as it has been developed here, depends in the\nfirst place on a choice by the investor of either the defensive (pas-\nsive) or aggressive (enterprising) role. The aggressive investor\nmust have a considerable knowledge of security values—enough,\nin fact, to warrant viewing his security operations as equivalent to\na business enterprise. There is no room in this philosophy for a\n*A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23% in two\ndays after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive damages of\nup to $200 billion against the company—which had finally admitted that cig-\narettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip Morris’s stock had doubled—\nonly to fall back after a later multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several\nother stocks have been virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including\nJohns Manville, W. R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a law-\nsuit” remains a valid rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.\nwww.fx1618.com176 The Intelligent Investor\nmiddle ground, or a series of gradations, between the passive and\naggressive status. Many, perhaps most, investors seek to place\nthemselves in such an intermediate category; in our opinion that is\na compromise that is more likely to produce disappointment than\nachievement.\nAs an investor you cannot soundly become “half a business-\nman,” expecting thereby to achieve half the normal rate of business\nprofits on your funds.\nIt follows from this reasoning that the majority of security own-\ners should elect the defensive classification. They do not have the\ntime, or the determination, or the mental equipment to embark\nupon investing as a quasi-business. They should therefore be satis-\nfied with the excellent return now obtainable from a defensive\nportfolio (and with even less), and they should stoutly resist the\nrecurrent temptation to increase this return by deviating into other\npaths.\nThe enterprising investor may properly embark upon any secu-\nrity operation for which his training and judgment are adequate\nand which appears sufficiently promising when measured by estab-\nlished business standards.\nIn our recommendations and caveats for this group of investors\nwe have attempted to apply such business standards. In those for\nthe defensive investor we have been guided largely by the three\nrequirements of underlying safety, simplicity of choice, and prom-\nise of satisfactory results, in terms of psychology as well as arith-\nmetic. The use of these criteria has led us to exclude from the field\nof recommended investment a number of security classes that are\nnormally regarded as suitable for various kinds of investors. These\nprohibitions were listed in our first chapter on p. 30.\nLet us consider a little more fully than before what is implied in\nthese exclusions. We have advised against the purchase at “full\nprices” of three important categories of securities: (1) foreign\nbonds, (2) ordinary preferred stocks, and (3) secondary common\nstocks, including, of course, original offerings of such issues. By\n“full prices” we mean prices close to par for bonds or preferred\nstocks, and prices that represent about the fair business value of\nthe enterprise in the case of common stocks. The greater number\nof defensive investors are to avoid these categories regardless of\nprice; the enterprising investor is to buy them only when obtain-\nwww.fx1618.comPortfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side 177\nable at bargain prices—which we define as prices not more than\ntwo-thirds of the appraisal value of the securities.\nWhat would happen if all investors were guided by our advice\nin these matters? That question was considered in regard to for-\neign bonds, on p. 138, and we have nothing to add at this point.\nInvestment-grade preferred stocks would be bought solely by cor-\nporations, such as insurance companies, which would benefit from\nthe special income-tax status of stock issues owned by them.\nThe most troublesome consequence of our policy of exclusion is\nin the field of secondary common stocks. If the majority of\ninvestors, being in the defensive class, are not to buy them at all,\nthe field of possible buyers becomes seriously restricted. Further-\nmore, if aggressive investors are to buy them only at bargain levels,\nthen these issues would be doomed to sell for less than their fair\nvalue, except to the extent that they were purchased unintelli-\ngently.\nThis may sound severe and even vaguely unethical. Yet in truth\nwe are merely recognizing what has actually happened in this area\nfor the greater part of the past 40 years. Secondary issues, for the\nmost part, do fluctuate about a central level which is well below\ntheir fair value. They reach and even surpass that value at times;\nbut this occurs in the upper reaches of bull markets, when the les-\nsons of practical experience would argue against the soundness of\npaying the prevailing prices for common stocks.\nThus we are suggesting only that the aggressive investor recog-\nnize the facts of life as it is lived by secondary issues and that they\naccept the central market levels that are normal for that class as\ntheir guide in fixing their own levels for purchase.\nThere is a paradox here, nevertheless. The average well-selected\nsecondary company may be fully as promising as the average\nindustrial leader. What the smaller concern lacks in inherent stabil-\nity it may readily make up in superior possibilities of growth. Con-\nsequently it may appear illogical to many readers to term\n“unintelligent” the purchase of such secondary issues at their full\n“enterprise value.” We think that the strongest logic is that of expe-\nrience. Financial history says clearly that the investor may expect\nsatisfactory results, on the average, from secondary common\nstocks only if he buys them for less than their value to a private\nowner, that is, on a bargain basis.\nwww.fx1618.com178 The Intelligent Investor\nThe last sentence indicates that this principle relates to the ordi-\nnary outside investor. Anyone who can control a secondary com-\npany, or who is part of a cohesive group with such control, is fully\njustified in buying the shares on the same basis as if he were invest-\ning in a “close corporation” or other private business. The distinc-\ntion between the position, and consequent investment policy, of\ninsiders and of outsiders becomes more important as the enterprise\nitself becomes lessimportant. It is a basic characteristic of a primary\nor leading company that a single detached share is ordinarily\nworth as much as a share in a controlling block. In secondary com-\npanies the averagemarket value of a detached share is substantially\nless than its worth to a controlling owner. Because of this fact, the\nmatter of shareholder-management relations and of those between\ninside and outside shareholders tends to be much more important\nand controversial in the case of secondary than in that of primary\ncompanies.\nAt the end of Chapter 5 we commented on the difficulty of mak-\ning any hard and fast distinction between primary and secondary\ncompanies. The many common stocks in the boundary area may\nproperly exhibit an intermediate price behavior. It would not be\nillogical for an investor to buy such an issue at a small discount\nfrom its indicated or appraisal value, on the theory that it is only a\nsmall distance away from a primary classification and that it may\nacquire such a rating unqualifiedly in the not too distant future.\nThus the distinction between primary and secondary issues\nneed not be made too precise; for, if it were, then a small difference\nin quality must produce a large differential in justified purchase\nprice. In saying this we are admitting a middle ground in the clas-\nsification of common stocks, although we counseled against such a\nmiddle ground in the classification of investors. Our reason for this\napparent inconsistency is as follows: No great harm comes from\nsome uncertainty of viewpoint regarding a single security, because\nsuch cases are exceptional and not a great deal is at stake in the\nmatter. But the investor’s choice as between the defensive or the\naggressive status is of major consequence to him, and he should\nnot allow himself to be confused or compromised in this basic deci-\nsion.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 7\nIt requires a great deal of boldness and a great deal of caution\nto make a great fortune; and when you have got it, it requires\nten times as much wit to keep it.\n—Nathan Mayer Rothschild\nTIMING IS NOTHING\nIn an ideal world, the intelligent investor would hold stocks only when\nthey are cheap and sell them when they become overpriced, then\nduck into the bunker of bonds and cash until stocks again become\ncheap enough to buy.

Let’s look at the tra-\njectories of three of the hottest growth stocks of the 1990s: General\nElectric, Home Depot, and Sun Microsystems. (See Figure 7-1.)\nIn every year from 1995 through 1999, each grew bigger and more\nprofitable. Revenues doubled at Sun and more than doubled at Home\nDepot. According to Value Line, GE’s revenues grew 29%; its earnings\nrose 65%. At Home Depot and Sun, earnings per share roughly tripled.\nBut something else was happening—and it wouldn’t have surprised\nGraham one bit. The faster these companies grew, the more expen-\nsive their stocks became. And when stocks grow faster than compa-\nnies, investors always end up sorry. As Figure 7-2 shows:\nA great company is not a great investment if you pay too much for\nthe stock.\nThe more a stock has gone up, the more it seems likely to keep going\nup. But that instinctive belief is flatly contradicted by a fundamental law\nof financial physics: The bigger they get, the slower they grow. A $1-\nbillion company can double its sales fairly easily; but where can a $50-\nbillion company turn to find another $50 billion in business?\nGrowth stocks are worth buying when their prices are reasonable,\nbut when their price/earnings ratios go much above 25 or 30 the odds\nget ugly:\n• Journalist Carol Loomis found that, from 1960 through 1999, only\neight of the largest 150 companies on the Fortune 500 list man-\naged to raise their earnings by an annual average of at least 15%\nfor two decades.6\n• Looking at five decades of data, the research firm of Sanford C.\nBernstein & Co. showed that only 10% of large U.S. companies\nhad increased their earnings by 20% for at least five consecutive\nyears; only 3% had grown by 20% for at least 10 years straight;\nand not a single one had done it for 15 years in a row.7\n6Carol J.

In February 2000, chief execu-\ntive John Roth of Nortel Networks was asked how much bigger\nhis giant fiber-optics company could get. “The industry is grow-\ning 14% to 15% a year,” Roth replied, “and we’re going to grow\nsix points faster than that. For a company our size, that’s pretty\nheady stuff.” Nortel’s stock, up nearly 51% annually over the pre-\nvious six years, was then trading at 87 times what Wall Street\nwas guessing it might earn in 2000. Was the stock overpriced?\n“It’s getting up there,” shrugged Roth, “but there’s still plenty of\nroom to grow our valuation as we execute on the wireless strat-\negy.” (After all, he added, Cisco Systems was trading at 121\ntimes its projected earnings!)1\nAs for Cisco, in November 2000, its chief executive, John\nChambers, insisted that his company could keep growing at\nleast 50% annually. “Logic,” he declared, “would indicate this is\na breakaway.” Cisco’s stock had come way down—it was then\ntrading at a mere 98 times its earnings over the previous year—\nand Chambers urged investors to buy. “So who you going to bet\non?” he asked. “Now may be the opportunity.”2\nInstead, these growth companies shrank—and their over-\npriced stocks shriveled. Nortel’s revenues fell by 37% in 2001,\nand the company lost more than $26 billion that year. Cisco’s\nrevenues did rise by 18% in 2001, but the company ended up\nwith a net loss of more than $1 billion. Nortel’s stock, at\n$113.50 when Roth spoke, finished 2002 at $1.65. Cisco’s\nshares, at $52 when Chambers called his company a “break-\naway,” crumbled to $13.\nBoth companies have since become more circumspect\nabout forecasting the future.\n1Lisa Gibbs, “Optic Uptick,” Money,April, 2000, pp. 54–55.\n2Brooke Southall, “Cisco’s Endgame Strategy,” InvestmentNews,November\n30, 2000, pp. 1, 23.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 7 185\nSHOULD YOU PUT ALL YOUR EGGS\nIN ONE BASKET?\n“Put all your eggs into one basket and then watch that basket,” pro-\nclaimed Andrew Carnegie a century ago. “Do not scatter your shot.\n...The great successes of life are made by concentration.” As Gra-\nham points out, “the really big fortunes from common stocks” have\nbeen made by people who packed all their money into one investment\nthey knew supremely well.\nNearly all the richest people in America trace their wealth to a con-\ncentrated investment in a single industry or even a single company\n(think Bill Gates and Microsoft, Sam Walton and Wal-Mart, or the\nRockefellers and Standard Oil). The Forbes 400 list of the richest\nAmericans, for example, has been dominated by undiversified fortunes\never since it was first compiled in 1982.\nHowever, almost no small fortunes have been made this way—and\nnot many big fortunes have been kept this way. What Carnegie neg-\nlected to mention is that concentration also makes most of the great\nfailuresof life. Look again at the Forbes“Rich List.” Back in 1982, the\naverage net worth of a Forbes 400 member was $230 million. To\nmake it onto the 2002 Forbes 400, the average 1982 member\nneeded to earn only a 4.5% average annual return on his wealth—\nduring a period when even bank accounts yielded far more than that\nand the stock market gained an annual average of 13.2%.\nSo how many of the Forbes 400 fortunes from 1982 remained on\nthe list 20 years later? Only 64 of the original members—a measly\n16%—were still on the list in 2002. By keeping all their eggs in the one\nbasket that had gotten them onto the list in the first place—once-\nbooming industries like oil and gas, or computer hardware, or basic\nmanufacturing—all the other original members fell away. When hard\ntimes hit, none of these people—despite all the huge advantages that\ngreat wealth can bring—were properly prepared. They could only\nstand by and wince at the sickening crunch as the constantly chang-\ning economy crushed their only basket and all their eggs.10\n10For the observation that it is amazingly difficult to remain on the Forbes\n400, I am indebted to investment manager Kenneth Fisher (himself a Forbes\ncolumnist).\nwww.fx1618.com186 Commentary on Chapter 7\nTHE BARGAIN BIN\nYou might think that in our endlessly networked world, it would be a\ncinch to build and buy a list of stocks that meet Graham’s criteria for\nbargains (p. 169). Although the Internet is a help, you’ll still have to do\nmuch of the work by hand.\nGrab a copy of today’s Wall Street Journal, turn to the “Money &\nInvesting” section, and take a look at the NYSE and NASDAQ Score-\ncards to find the day’s lists of stocks that have hit new lows for the\npast year—a quick and easy way to search for companies that might\npass Graham’s net-working-capital tests. (Online, try http://quote.\nmorningstar.com/highlow.html?msection=HighLow.)\nTosee whether a stock is selling for less than the value of net work-\ning capital (what Graham’s followers call “net nets”), download or\nrequest the most recent quarterly or annual report from the company’s\nwebsite or from the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. From the\ncompany’s current assets, subtract its total liabilities, including any\npreferred stock and long-term debt. (Or consult your local public\nlibrary’s copy of the Value Line Investment Survey, saving yourself a\ncostly annual subscription. Each issue carries a list of “Bargain Base-\nment Stocks” that come close to Graham’s definition.) Most of these\nstocks lately have been in bombed-out areas like high-tech and\ntelecommunications.\nAs of October 31, 2002, for instance, Comverse Technology had\n$2.4 billion in current assets and $1.0 billion in total liabilities, giving it\n$1.4 billion in net working capital. With fewer than 190 million shares\nof stock, and a stock price under $8 per share, Comverse had a total\nmarket capitalization of just under $1.4 billion. With the stock priced\nat no more than the value of Comverse’s cash and inventories, the\ncompany’s ongoing business was essentially selling for nothing. As\nGraham knew, you can still lose money on a stock like Comverse—\nwhich is why you should buy them only if you can find a couple dozen\nat a time and hold them patiently. But on the very rare occasions when\nMr. Market generates that many true bargains, you’re all but certain to\nmake money.\nWHAT’S YOUR FOREIGN POLICY?\nInvesting in foreign stocks may not be mandatory for the intelligent\ninvestor,w bwut wit .isfx d1e6fin1ite8ly. caodvmisable. Why? Let’s try a little thoughtCommentary on Chapter 7 187\nexperiment. It’s the end of 1989, and you’re Japanese. Here are the\nfacts:\n• Over the past 10 years, your stock market has gained an annual\naverage of 21.2%, well ahead of the 17.5% annual gains in the\nUnited States.\n• Japanese companies are buying up everything in the United\nStates from the Pebble Beach golf course to Rockefeller Center;\nmeanwhile, American firms like Drexel Burnham Lambert, Finan-\ncial Corp. of America, and Texaco are going bankrupt.\n• The U.S. high-tech industry is dying. Japan’s is booming.\nIn 1989, in the land of the rising sun, you can only conclude that\ninvesting outside of Japan is the dumbest idea since sushi vending\nmachines. Naturally, you put all your money in Japanese stocks.\nThe result? Over the next decade, you lose roughly two-thirds of\nyour money.\nThe lesson? It’s not that you should never invest in foreign markets\nlike Japan; it’s that the Japanese should never have kept all their\nmoney at home. And neither should you. If you live in the United\nStates, work in the United States, and get paid in U.S. dollars, you are\nalready making a multilayered bet on the U.S. economy. To be prudent,\nyou should put some of your investment portfolio elsewhere—simply\nbecause no one, anywhere, can ever know what the future will bring at\nhome or abroad. Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual\nfunds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets)\nhelps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be\nthe best place in the world to invest.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 8\nThe Investor and Market Fluctuations\nT\no the extent that the investor’s funds are placed in high-grade\nbonds of relatively short maturity—say, of seven years or less—he\nwill not be affected significantly by changes in market prices and\nneed not take them into account. (This applies also to his holdings\nof U.S. savings bonds, which he can always turn in at his cost price\nor more.) His longer-term bonds may have relatively wide price\nswings during their lifetimes, and his common-stock portfolio is\nalmost certain to fluctuate in value over any period of several\nyears.\nThe investor should know about these possibilities and should\nbe prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will\nwant to benefit from changes in market levels—certainly through\nan advance in the value of his stock holdings as time goes on, and\nperhaps also by making purchases and sales at advantageous\nprices. This interest on his part is inevitable, and legitimate\nenough. But it involves the very real danger that it will lead him\ninto speculative attitudes and activities. It is easy for us to tell you\nnot to speculate; the hard thing will be for you to follow this\nadvice. Let us repeat what we said at the outset: If you want to\nspeculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you will proba-\nbly lose money in the end; be sure to limit the amount at risk and to\nseparate it completely from your investment program.\nWe shall deal first with the more important subject of price\nchanges in common stocks, and pass later to the area of bonds.\nIn Chapter 3 we supplied a historical survey of the stock market’s\naction over the past hundred years. In this section we shall return\nto that material from time to time, in order to see what the past\nrecord promises the investor—in either the form of long-term\nappreciation of a portfolio held relatively unchanged through\nwww.fx1618.com\n188The Investor and Market Fluctuations 189\nsuccessive rises and declines, or in the possibilities of buying\nnear bear-market lows and selling not too far below bull-market\nhighs.\nMarket Fluctuations as a Guide to Investment Decisions\nSince common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to\nrecurrent and wide fluctuations in their prices, the intelligent\ninvestor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from\nthese pendulum swings. There are two possible ways by which\nhe may try to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing.\nBy timing we mean the endeavor to anticipate the action of the\nstock market—to buy or hold when the future course is deemed\nto be upward, to sell or refrain from buying when the course\nis downward. By pricing we mean the endeavor to buy stocks\nwhen they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when\nthey rise above such value. A less ambitious form of pricing is\nthe simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not\npay too much for your stocks. This may suffice for the defen-\nsive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; but as\nsuch it represents an essential minimum of attention to market\nlevels.1\nWe are convinced that the intelligent investor can derive satis-\nfactory results from pricing of either type. We are equally sure that\nif he places his emphasis on timing, in the sense of forecasting, he\nwill end up as a speculator and with a speculator’s financial\nresults. This distinction may seem rather tenuous to the layman,\nand it is not commonly accepted on Wall Street. As a matter of\nbusiness practice, or perhaps of thoroughgoing conviction, the\nstock brokers and the investment services seem wedded to the\nprinciple that both investors and speculators in common stocks\nshould devote careful attention to market forecasts.\nThe farther one gets from Wall Street, the more skepticism one\nwill find, we believe, as to the pretensions of stock-market forecast-\ning or timing. The investor can scarcely take seriously the innumer-\nable predictions which appear almost daily and are his for the\nasking. Yet in many cases he pays attention to them and even acts\nupon them. Why? Because he has been persuaded that it is impor-\ntant for him to form someopinion of the future course of the stock\nwww.fx1618.com190 The Intelligent Investor\nmarket, and because he feels that the brokerage or service forecast\nis at least more dependable than his own.*\nWe lack space here to discuss in detail the pros and cons of mar-\nket forecasting. Agreat deal of brain power goes into this field, and\nundoubtedly some people can make money by being good stock-\nmarket analysts. But it is absurd to think that the general publiccan\never make money out of market forecasts. For who will buy when\nthe general public, at a given signal, rushes to sell out at a profit? If\nyou, the reader, expect to get rich over the years by following some\nsystem or leadership in market forecasting, you must be expecting\nto try to do what countless others are aiming at, and to be able to\ndo it better than your numerous competitors in the market. There\nis no basis either in logic or in experience for assuming that any\ntypical or average investor can anticipate market movements more\nsuccessfully than the general public, of which he is himself a part.\nThere is one aspect of the “timing” philosophy which seems to\nhave escaped everyone’s notice. Timing is of great psychological\nimportance to the speculator because he wants to make his profit in\n*In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became more influ-\nential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become more accurate.\nOn March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite index hit its\nall-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities’s chief technical analyst\nRalph Acampora said in USA Todaythat he expected NASDAQ to hit 6000\nwithin 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had already shriveled to\n3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &\nJenrette, declared that “there’s only 200 or 300 points of downside for the\nNASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It turned out that there were no points\non the upside and more than 2000 on the downside, as NASDAQ kept\ncrashing until it finally scraped bottom on October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In\nMarch 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman,\nSachs & Co., predicted that the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index would\nclose the year at 1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would\nfinish 2001 at 13,000. “We do not expect a recession,” said Cohen, “and\nbelieve that corporate profits are likely to grow at close to trend growth\nrates later this year.” The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as\nshe spoke, and the S & P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the Dow fin-\nished at 10,021.50—30% and 23% below her forecasts, respectively.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 191\na hurry. The idea of waiting a year before his stock moves up is\nrepugnant to him. But a waiting period, as such, is of no conse-\nquence to the investor. What advantage is there to him in having\nhis money uninvested until he receives some (presumably) trust-\nworthy signal that the time has come to buy? He enjoys an advan-\ntage only if by waiting he succeeds in buying later at a sufficiently\nlower priceto offset his loss of dividend income. What this means is\nthat timing is of no real value to the investor unless it coincides\nwith pricing—that is, unless it enables him to repurchase his shares\nat substantially under his previous selling price.\nIn this respect the famous Dow theory for timing purchases and\nsales has had an unusual history.* Briefly, this technique takes its\nsignal to buy from a special kind of “breakthrough” of the stock\naverages on the up side, and its selling signal from a similar break-\nthrough on the down side. The calculated—not necessarily\nactual—results of using this method showed an almost unbroken\nseries of profits in operations from 1897 to the early 1960s. On the\nbasis of this presentation the practical value of the Dow theory\nwould have appeared firmly established; the doubt, if any, would\napply to the dependability of this published “record” as a picture\nof what a Dow theorist would actually have done in the market.\nA closer study of the figures indicates that the quality of the\nresults shown by the Dow theory changed radically after 1938—\na few years after the theory had begun to be taken seriously on\nWall Street. Its spectacular achievement had been in giving a sell\nsignal, at 306, about a month before the 1929 crash and in keeping\nits followers out of the long bear market until things had pretty\nwell righted themselves, at 84, in 1933. But from 1938 on the Dow\ntheory operated mainly by taking its practitioners out at a pretty\ngood price but then putting them back in again at a higher price.\nFor nearly 30 years thereafter, one would have done appreciably\nbetter by just buying and holding the DJIA.2\nIn our view, based on much study of this problem, the change in\nthe Dow-theory results is not accidental. It demonstrates an inher-\nent characteristic of forecasting and trading formulas in the fields\nof business and finance. Those formulas that gain adherents and\n*See p. 3.\nwww.fx1618.com192 The Intelligent Investor\nimportance do so because they have worked well over a period, or\nsometimes merely because they have been plausibly adapted to the\nstatistical record of the past. But as their acceptance increases, their\nreliability tends to diminish. This happens for two reasons: First,\nthe passage of time brings new conditions which the old formula\nno longer fits. Second, in stock-market affairs the popularity of a\ntrading theory has itself an influence on the market’s behavior\nwhich detracts in the long run from its profit-making possibilities.\n(The popularity of something like the Dow theory may seem to cre-\nate its own vindication, since it would make the market advance or\ndecline by the very action of its followers when a buying or selling\nsignal is given. A“stampede” of this kind is, of course, much more\nof a danger than an advantage to the public trader.)\nBuy-Low–Sell-High Approach\nWeare convinced that the average investor cannot deal success-\nfully with price movements by endeavoring to forecast them. Can\nhe benefit from them after they have taken place—i.e., by buying\nafter each major decline and selling out after each major advance?\nThe fluctuations of the market over a period of many years prior to\n1950 lent considerable encouragement to that idea. In fact, a classic\ndefinition of a “shrewd investor” was “one who bought in a bear\nmarket when everyone else was selling, and sold out in a bull mar-\nket when everyone else was buying.” If we examine our Chart I,\ncovering the fluctuations of the Standard & Poor’s composite index\nbetween 1900 and 1970, and the supporting figures in Table 3-1 (p.\n66), we can readily see why this viewpoint appeared valid until\nfairly recent years.\nBetween 1897 and 1949 there were ten complete market cycles,\nrunning from bear-market low to bull-market high and back to\nbear-market low. Six of these took no longer than four years, four\nran for six or seven years, and one—the famous “new-era” cycle of\n1921–1932—lasted eleven years. The percentage of advance from\nthe lows to highs ranged from 44% to 500%, with most between\nabout 50% and 100%. The percentage of subsequent declines\nranged from 24% to 89%, with most found between 40% and 50%.\n(It should be remembered that a decline of 50% fully offsets a pre-\nceding advance of 100%.)\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 193\nNearly all the bull markets had a number of well-defined char-\nacteristics in common, such as (1) a historically high price level, (2)\nhigh price/earnings ratios, (3) low dividend yields as against bond\nyields, (4) much speculation on margin, and (5) many offerings of\nnew common-stock issues of poor quality. Thus to the student of\nstock-market history it appeared that the intelligent investor\nshould have been able to identify the recurrent bear and bull mar-\nkets, to buy in the former and sell in the latter, and to do so for the\nmost part at reasonably short intervals of time. Various methods\nwere developed for determining buying and selling levels of the\ngeneral market, based on either value factors or percentage move-\nments of prices or both.\nBut we must point out that even prior to the unprecedented bull\nmarket that began in 1949, there were sufficient variations in the\nsuccessive market cycles to complicate and sometimes frustrate the\ndesirable process of buying low and selling high. The most notable\nof these departures, of course, was the great bull market of the late\n1920s, which threw all calculations badly out of gear.* Even in 1949,\ntherefore, it was by no means a certainty that the investor could\nbase his financial policies and procedures mainly on the endeavor\nto buy at low levels in bear markets and to sell out at high levels in\nbull markets.\nIt turned out, in the sequel, that the opposite was true. The\n*Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone waiting to\n“buy low” will feel completely left behind—and, all too often, will end up\nabandoning any former caution and jumping in with both feet. That’s why\nGraham’s message about the importance of emotional discipline is so\nimportant. From October 1990 through January 2000, the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing more than\n20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The total gain\n(not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall, Pierce & Co., this\nwas the second-longest uninterrupted bull market of the past century; only\nthe 1949–1961 boom lasted longer. The longer a bull market lasts, the\nmore severely investors will be afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so,\nmany people no longer believe that bear markets are even possible. All\nthose who forget are doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market,\nrecovered memories are always unpleasant.\nwww.fx1618.com194 The Intelligent Investor\nmarket’s behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the former\npattern, nor obeyed what once were well-established danger sig-\nnals, nor permitted its successful exploitation by applying old rules\nfor buying low and selling high. Whether the old, fairly regular\nbull-and-bear-market pattern will eventually return we do not\nknow. But it seems unrealistic to us for the investor to endeavor to\nbase his present policy on the classic formula—i.e., to wait for\ndemonstrable bear-market levels before buying any common\nstocks. Our recommended policy has, however, made provision\nfor changes in the proportion of common stocks to bonds in the\nportfolio, if the investor chooses to do so, according as the level\nof stock prices appears less or more attractive by value stan-\ndards.*\nFormula Plans\nIn the early years of the stock-market rise that began in 1949–50\nconsiderable interest was attracted to various methods of taking\nadvantage of the stock market’s cycles. These have been known as\n“formula investment plans.” The essence of all such plans—except\nthe simple case of dollar averaging—is that the investor automati-\ncally does some selling of common stocks when the market\nadvances substantially. In many of them a very large rise in the\nmarket level would result in the sale of all common-stock holdings;\nothers provided for retention of a minor proportion of equities\nunder all circumstances.\nThis approach had the double appeal of sounding logical (and\nconservative) and of showing excellent results when applied retro-\nspectively to the stock market over many years in the past. Unfor-\ntunately, its vogue grew greatest at the very time when it was\ndestined to work least well. Many of the “formula planners” found\nthemselves entirely or nearly out of the stock market at some level\nin the middle 1950s. True, they had realized excellent profits, but in\na broad sense the market “ran away” from them thereafter, and\n*Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4 (pp. 89–91).\nThis policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is widely followed by insti-\ntutional investors like pension funds and university endowments.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 195\ntheir formulas gave them little opportunity to buy back a common-\nstock position.*\nThere is a similarity between the experience of those adopting\nthe formula-investing approach in the early 1950s and those who\nembraced the purely mechanical version of the Dow theory some\n20 years earlier. In both cases the advent of popularity marked\nalmost the exact moment when the system ceased to work well. We\nhave had a like discomfiting experience with our own “central\nvalue method” of determining indicated buying and selling levels\nof the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The moral seems to be that\nany approach to moneymaking in the stock market which can be\neasily described and followed by a lot of people is by its terms too\nsimple and too easy to last.† Spinoza’s concluding remark applies\nto Wall Street as well as to philosophy: “All things excellent are as\ndifficult as they are rare.”\nMarket Fluctuations of the Investor’s Portfolio\nEvery investor who owns common stocks must expect to see\nthem fluctuate in value over the years. The behavior of the DJIA\nsince our last edition was written in 1964 probably reflects pretty\nwell what has happened to the stock portfolio of a conservative\ninvestor who limited his stock holdings to those of large, promi-\nnent, and conservatively financed corporations. The overall value\nadvanced from an average level of about 890 to a high of 995 in\n*Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks at the\nend of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the second-highest\nyearly return then on record. Over the next five years, these market-timers\nwould likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks doubled.\n†Easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons: the\nnatural tendency of trends to reverse over time, or “regress to the mean,”\nand the rapid adoption of the stock-picking scheme by large numbers of\npeople, who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got there first. (Note\nthat, in referring to his “discomfiting experience,” Graham is—as always—\nhonest in admitting his own failures.) See Jason Zweig, “Murphy Was an\nInvestor,” Money, July, 2002, pp. 61–62, and Jason Zweig, “New Year’s\nPlay,” Money,December, 2000, pp. 89–90.\nwww.fx1618.com196 The Intelligent Investor\n1966 (and 985 again in 1968), fell to 631 in 1970, and made an\nalmost full recovery to 940 in early 1971. (Since the individual\nissues set their high and low marks at different times, the fluc-\ntuations in the Dow Jones group as a whole are less severe than\nthose in the separate components.) We have traced through the\nprice fluctuations of other types of diversified and conservative\ncommon-stock portfolios and we find that the overall results are\nnot likely to be markedly different from the above. In general, the\nshares of second-line companies* fluctuate more widely than the\nmajor ones, but this does not necessarily mean that a group of well-\nestablished but smaller companies will make a poorer showing\nover a fairly long period. In any case the investor may as well\nresign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere\npossibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more\nfrom their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more\nfrom their high point at various periods in the next five years.†\nAserious investor is not likely to believe that the day-to-day or\neven month-to-month fluctuations of the stock market make him\nricher or poorer. But what about the longer-term and wider\nchanges? Here practical questions present themselves, and the psy-\nchological problems are likely to grow complicated. Asubstantial\nrise in the market is at once a legitimate reason for satisfaction and\na cause for prudent concern, but it may also bring a strong tempta-\ntion toward imprudent action. Your shares have advanced, good!\n*Today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “second-line companies” would\nbe any of the thousands of stocks not included in the Standard & Poor’s\n500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500 stocks in the S & P index\nis available at www.standardandpoors.com.\n†Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible, but prob-\nable, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50% from their low-\nest price and lose at least 33% from their highest price—regardless of which\nstocks you own or whether the market as a whole goes up or down. If you\ncan’t live with that—or you think your portfolio is somehow magically exempt\nfrom it—then you are not yet entitled to call yourself an investor. (Graham\nrefers to a 33% decline as the “equivalent one-third” because a 50% gain\ntakes a $10 stock to $15. From $15, a 33% loss [or $5 drop] takes it right\nback to $10, where it started.)\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 197\nYou are richer than you were, good! But has the price risen toohigh,\nand should you think of selling? Or should you kick yourself for\nnot having bought more shares when the level was lower? Or—\nworst thought of all—should you now give way to the bull-market\natmosphere, become infected with the enthusiasm, the overconfi-\ndence and the greed of the great public (of which, after all, you are\na part), and make larger and dangerous commitments? Presented\nthus in print, the answer to the last question is a self-evident no,but\neven the intelligent investor is likely to need considerable will\npower to keep from following the crowd.\nIt is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calcu-\nlation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechan-\nical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the\ninvestor’s portfolio. The chief advantage, perhaps, is that such a\nformula will give him something to do.As the market advances he\nwill from time to time make sales out of his stockholdings, putting\nthe proceeds into bonds; as it declines he will reverse the proce-\ndure. These activities will provide some outlet for his otherwise\ntoo-pent-up energies. If he is the right kind of investor he will take\nadded satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly\nopposite from those of the crowd.*\nBusiness Valuations versus Stock-Market Valuations\nThe impact of market fluctuations upon the investor’s true situ-\nation may be considered also from the standpoint of the share-\nholder as the part owner of various businesses. The holder of\nmarketable shares actually has a double status, and with it the\nprivilege of taking advantage of either at his choice. On the one\nhand his position is analogous to that of a minority shareholder or\nsilent partner in a private business. Here his results are entirely\ndependent on the profits of the enterprise or on a change in the\nunderlying value of its assets. He would usually determine the\nvalue of such a private-business interest by calculating his share of\nthe net worth as shown in the most recent balance sheet. On the\n*For today’s investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this “formula” is rebal-\nancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.\nwww.fx1618.com198 The Intelligent Investor\nother hand, the common-stock investor holds a piece of paper, an\nengraved stock certificate, which can be sold in a matter of minutes\nat a price which varies from moment to moment—when the mar-\nket is open, that is—and often is far removed from the balance-\nsheet value.*\nThe development of the stock market in recent decades has\nmade the typical investor more dependent on the course of price\nquotations and less free than formerly to consider himself merely a\nbusiness owner. The reason is that the successful enterprises in\nwhich he is likely to concentrate his holdings sell almost constantly\nat prices well above their net asset value (or book value, or\n“balance-sheet value”). In paying these market premiums the\ninvestor gives precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on\nthe stock market itself to validate his commitments.†\nThis is a factor of prime importance in present-day investing,\nand it has received less attention than it deserves. The whole struc-\nture of stock-market quotations contains a built-in contradiction.\nThe better a company’s record and prospects, the less relationship\nthe price of its shares will have to their book value. But the greater\nthe premium above book value, the less certain the basis of deter-\nmining its intrinsic value—i.e., the more this “value” will depend\non the changing moods and measurements of the stock market.\nThus we reach the final paradox, that the more successful the com-\npany, the greater are likely to be the fluctuations in the price of its\nshares. This really means that, in a very real sense, the better the\n*Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only upon\nspecial request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely electronic form\n(much as your bank account contains computerized credits and debits, not\nactual currency) and thus have become even easier to trade than they were\nin Graham’s day.\n†Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and tangible-asset value\nare all synonyms for net worth, or the total value of a company’s physical\nand financial assets minus all its liabilities. It can be calculated using the bal-\nance sheets in a company’s annual and quarterly reports; from total share-\nholders’ equity, subtract all “soft” assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and\nother intangibles. Divide by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to\narrive at book value per share.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 199\nquality of a common stock, the more speculativeit is likely to be—at\nleast as compared with the unspectacular middle-grade issues.*\n(What we have said applies to a comparison of the leading growth\ncompanies with the bulk of well-established concerns; we exclude\nfrom our purview here those issues which are highly speculative\nbecause the businesses themselves are speculative.)\nThe argument made above should explain the often erratic price\nbehavior of our most successful and impressive enterprises. Our\nfavorite example is the monarch of them all—International Busi-\nness Machines. The price of its shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven\nmonths in 1962–63; after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in\n1970. Similarly, Xerox—an even more impressive earnings gainer\nin recent decades—fell from 171 to 87 in 1962–63, and from 116 to\n65 in 1970. These striking losses did not indicate any doubt about\nthe future long-term growth of IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead\na lack of confidence in the premium valuation that the stock mar-\nket itself had placed on these excellent prospects.\nThe previous discussion leads us to a conclusion of practical\nimportance to the conservative investor in common stocks. If he is\nto pay some special attention to the selection of his portfolio, it\nmight be best for him to concentrate on issues selling at a reason-\nably close approximation to their tangible-asset value—say, at not\nmore than one-third above that figure. Purchases made at such\nlevels, or lower, may with logic be regarded as related to the\n*Graham’s use of the word “paradox” is probably an allusion to a classic\narticle by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg Paradox,” The\nJournal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957, pp. 348–363, which\ncompares investing in high-priced growth stocks to betting on a series of\ncoin flips in which the payoff escalates with each flip of the coin. Durand\npoints out that if a growth stock could continue to grow at a high rate for\nan indefinite period of time, an investor should (in theory) be willing to pay\nan infinite price for its shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a\nprice of infinity dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future\ngrowth rate, and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the\nwider the margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny mis-\ncalculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in Appendix 4\n(p. 570).\nwww.fx1618.com200 The Intelligent Investor\ncompany’s balance sheet, and as having a justification or support\nindependent of the fluctuating market prices. The premium over\nbook value that may be involved can be considered as a kind of\nextra fee paid for the advantage of stock-exchange listing and the\nmarketability that goes with it.\nA caution is needed here. A stock does not become a sound\ninvestment merely because it can be bought at close to its asset\nvalue. The investor should demand, in addition, a satisfactory ratio\nof earnings to price, a sufficiently strong financial position, and the\nprospect that its earnings will at least be maintained over the years.\nThis may appear like demanding a lot from a modestly priced\nstock, but the prescription is not hard to fill under all but danger-\nously high market conditions. Once the investor is willing to forgo\nbrilliant prospects—i.e., better than average expected growth—he\nwill have no difficulty in finding a wide selection of issues meeting\nthese criteria.\nIn our chapters on the selection of common stocks (Chapters 14\nand 15) we shall give data showing that more than half of the DJIA\nissues met our asset-value criterion at the end of 1970. The most\nwidely held investment of all—American Tel. & Tel.—actually sells\nbelow its tangible-asset value as we write. Most of the light-and-\npower shares, in addition to their other advantages, are now (early\n1972) available at prices reasonably close to their asset values.\nThe investor with a stock portfolio having such book values\nbehind it can take a much more independent and detached view of\nstock-market fluctuations than those who have paid high multipli-\ners of both earnings and tangible assets. As long as the earning\npower of his holdings remains satisfactory, he can give as little\nattention as he pleases to the vagaries of the stock market. More\nthan that, at times he can use these vagaries to play the master\ngame of buying low and selling high.\nThe A. & P. Example\nAt this point we shall introduce one of our original examples,\nwhich dates back many years but which has a certain fascination\nfor us because it combines so many aspects of corporate and\ninvestment experience. It involves the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea\nCo. Here is the story:\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 201\nA. & P. shares were introduced to trading on the “Curb” market,\nnow the American Stock Exchange, in 1929 and sold as high as 494.\nBy 1932 they had declined to 104, although the company’s earnings\nwere nearly as large in that generally catastrophic year as previ-\nously. In 1936 the range was between 111 and 131. Then in the busi-\nness recession and bear market of 1938 the shares fell to a new low\nof 36.\nThat price was extraordinary. It meant that the preferred and\ncommon were together selling for $126 million, although the com-\npany had just reported that it held $85 million in cash alone and a\nworking capital (or net current assets) of $134 million. A. & P. was\nthe largest retail enterprise in America, if not in the world, with a\ncontinuous and impressive record of large earnings for many\nyears. Yet in 1938 this outstanding business was considered on\nWall Street to be worth less than its current assets alone—which\nmeans less as a going concern than if it were liquidated. Why?\nFirst, because there were threats of special taxes on chain stores;\nsecond, because net profits had fallen off in the previous year; and,\nthird, because the general market was depressed. The first of these\nreasons was an exaggerated and eventually groundless fear; the\nother two were typical of temporary influences.\nLet us assume that the investor had bought A. & P. common in\n1937 at, say, 12 times its five-year average earnings, or about 80. We\nare far from asserting that the ensuing decline to 36 was of no\nimportance to him. He would have been well advised to scrutinize\nthe picture with some care, to see whether he had made any mis-\ncalculations. But if the results of his study were reassuring—as\nthey should have been—he was entitled then to disregard the mar-\nket decline as a temporary vagary of finance, unless he had the\nfunds and the courage to take advantage of it by buying more on\nthe bargain basis offered.\nSequel and Reflections\nThe following year, 1939, A. & P. shares advanced to 1171⁄, or\n2\nthree times the low price of 1938 and well above the average of\n1937. Such a turnabout in the behavior of common stocks is by no\nmeans uncommon, but in the case of A. & P. it was more striking\nthan most. In the years after 1949 the grocery chain’s shares rose\nwww.fx1618.com202 The Intelligent Investor\nwith the general market until in 1961 the split-up stock (10 for 1)\nreached a high of 701⁄ which was equivalent to 705 for the 1938\n2\nshares.\nThis price of 701⁄ was remarkable for the fact it was 30 times the\n2\nearnings of 1961. Such a price/earnings ratio—which compares\nwith 23 times for the DJIAin that year—must have implied expec-\ntations of a brilliant growth in earnings. This optimism had no jus-\ntification in the company’s earnings record in the preceding years,\nand it proved completely wrong. Instead of advancing rapidly, the\ncourse of earnings in the ensuing period was generally downward.\nThe year after the 701⁄ high the price fell by more than half to 34.\n2\nBut this time the shares did not have the bargain quality that they\nshowed at the low quotation in 1938. After varying sorts of fluctua-\ntions the price fell to another low of 211⁄ in 1970 and 18 in 1972—\n2\nhaving reported the first quarterly deficitin its history.\nWe see in this history how wide can be the vicissitudes of a\nmajor American enterprise in little more than a single generation,\nand also with what miscalculations and excesses of optimism and\npessimism the public has valued its shares. In 1938 the business\nwas really being given away, with no takers; in 1961 the public was\nclamoring for the shares at a ridiculously high price. After that\ncame a quick loss of half the market value, and some years later a\nsubstantial further decline. In the meantime the company was to\nturn from an outstanding to a mediocre earnings performer; its\nprofit in the boom-year 1968 was to be less than in 1958; it had paid\na series of confusing small stock dividends not warranted by the\ncurrent additions to surplus; and so forth. A. & P. was a larger com-\npany in 1961 and 1972 than in 1938, but not as well-run, not as\nprofitable, and not as attractive.*\nThere are two chief morals to this story. The first is that the stock\nmarket often goes far wrong, and sometimes an alert and coura-\n*The more recent history of A & P is no different. At year-end 1999, its\nshare price was $27.875; at year-end 2000, $7.00; a year later, $23.78; at\nyear-end 2002, $8.06. Although some accounting irregularities later came\nto light at A & P, it defies all logic to believe that the value of a relatively sta-\nble business like groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the\nnext year, then drop by two-thirds the year after that.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 203\ngeous investor can take advantage of its patent errors. The other is\nthat most businesses change in character and quality over the\nyears, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse.\nThe investor need not watch his companies’ performance like a\nhawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time.\nLet us return to our comparison between the holder of mar-\nketable shares and the man with an interest in a private business.\nWehave said that the former has the optionof considering himself\nmerely as the part owner of the various businesses he has invested\nin, or as the holder of shares which are salable at any time he\nwishes at their quoted market price.\nBut note this important fact: The true investor scarcely ever is\nforced to sellhis shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard\nthe current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act\nupon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.* Thus\nthe investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly wor-\nried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely\ntransforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That\nman would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at\nall, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by\nother persons’mistakes of judgment.†\nIncidentally, a widespread situation of this kind actually existed\nduring the dark depression days of 1931–1933. There was then a\npsychological advantage in owning business interests that had no\nquoted market. For example, people who owned first mortgages\non real estate that continued to pay interest were able to tell them-\nselves that their investments had kept their full value, there being\nno market quotations to indicate otherwise. On the other hand,\nmany listed corporation bonds of even better quality and greater\n*“Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the extent that the\nprice is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.” In traditional brokerage\nlingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of holdings and trades.\n†This may well be the single most important paragraph in Graham’s entire\nbook. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of experience. You\ncannot read these words too often; they are like Kryptonite for bear markets.\nIf you keep them close at hand and let them guide you throughout your\ninvesting life, you will survive whatever the markets throw at you.\nwww.fx1618.com204 The Intelligent Investor\nunderlying strength suffered severe shrinkages in their market\nquotations, thus making their owners believe they were growing\ndistinctly poorer. In reality the owners were better off with the\nlisted securities, despite the low prices of these. For if they had\nwanted to, or were compelled to, they could at least have sold the\nissues—possibly to exchange them for even better bargains. Or\nthey could just as logically have ignored the market’s action as\ntemporary and basically meaningless. But it is self-deception to tell\nyourself that you have suffered no shrinkage in value merely\nbecauseyour securities have no quoted market at all.\nReturning to our A. & P. shareholder in 1938, we assert that as\nlong as he held on to his shares he suffered no loss in their price\ndecline, beyond what his own judgment may have told him was\noccasioned by a shrinkage in their underlying or intrinsic value. If\nno such shrinkage had occurred, he had a right to expect that in\ndue course the market quotation would return to the 1937 level or\nbetter—as in fact it did the following year. In this respect his posi-\ntion was at least as good as if he had owned an interest in a private\nbusiness with no quoted market for its shares. For in that case, too,\nhe might or might not have been justified in mentally lopping off\npart of the cost of his holdings because of the impact of the 1938\nrecession—depending on what had happened to his company.\nCritics of the value approach to stock investment argue that\nlisted common stocks cannot properly be regarded or appraised in\nthe same way as an interest in a similar private enterprise, because\nthe presence of an organized security market “injects into equity\nownership the new and extremely important attribute of liquidity.”\nBut what this liquidity really means is, first, that the investor has\nthe benefit of the stock market’s daily and changing appraisal of\nhis holdings, for whatever that appraisal may be worth, and, second,\nthat the investor is able to increase or decrease his investment at\nthe market’s daily figure—if he chooses. Thus the existence of a\nquoted market gives the investor certain options that he does not\nhave if his security is unquoted. But it does not impose the current\nquotation on an investor who prefers to take his idea of value from\nsome other source.\nLet us close this section with something in the nature of a para-\nble. Imagine that in some private business you own a small share\nthat cost you $1,000. One of your partners, named Mr. Market, is\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 205\nvery obliging indeed. Every day he tells you what he thinks your\ninterest is worth and furthermore offers either to buy you out or to\nsell you an additional interest on that basis. Sometimes his idea of\nvalue appears plausible and justified by business developments\nand prospects as you know them. Often, on the other hand, Mr.\nMarket lets his enthusiasm or his fears run away with him, and the\nvalue he proposes seems to you a little short of silly.\nIf you are a prudent investor or a sensible businessman, will you\nlet Mr. Market’s daily communication determine your view of the\nvalue of a $1,000 interest in the enterprise? Only in case you agree\nwith him, or in case you want to trade with him. You may be happy\nto sell out to him when he quotes you a ridiculously high price,\nand equally happy to buy from him when his price is low. But the\nrest of the time you will be wiser to form your own ideas of the\nvalue of your holdings, based on full reports from the company\nabout its operations and financial position.\nThe true investor is in that very position when he owns a listed\ncommon stock. He can take advantage of the daily market price or\nleave it alone, as dictated by his own judgment and inclination. He\nmust take cognizance of important price movements, for otherwise\nhis judgment will have nothing to work on. Conceivably they may\ngive him a warning signal which he will do well to heed—this in\nplain English means that he is to sell his shares becausethe price has\ngone down, foreboding worse things to come. In our view such sig-\nnals are misleading at least as often as they are helpful. Basically,\nprice fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true\ninvestor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely\nwhen prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a\ngreat deal. At other times he will do better if he forgets about the\nstock market and pays attention to his dividend returns and to the\noperating results of his companies.\nSummary\nThe most realistic distinction between the investor and the spec-\nulator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements.\nThe speculator’s primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting\nfrom market fluctuations. The investor’s primary interest lies in\nacquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market\nwww.fx1618.com206 The Intelligent Investor\nmovements are important to him in a practical sense, because they\nalternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to\nbuy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from\nbuying and probably would be wise to sell.\nIt is far from certain that the typical investor should regularly\nhold off buying until low market levels appear, because this may\ninvolve a long wait, very likely the loss of income, and the possible\nmissing of investment opportunities. On the whole it may be better\nfor the investor to do his stock buying whenever he has money to\nput in stocks, exceptwhen the general market level is much higher\nthan can be justified by well-established standards of value. If he\nwants to be shrewd he can look for the ever-present bargain oppor-\ntunities in individual securities.\nAside from forecasting the movements of the general market,\nmuch effort and ability are directed on Wall Street toward selecting\nstocks or industrial groups that in matter of price will “do better”\nthan the rest over a fairly short period in the future. Logical as this\nendeavor may seem, we do not believe it is suited to the needs or\ntemperament of the true investor—particularly since he would be\ncompeting with a large number of stock-market traders and first-\nclass financial analysts who are trying to do the same thing. As\nin all other activities that emphasize price movements first and\nunderlying values second, the work of many intelligent minds con-\nstantly engaged in this field tends to be self-neutralizing and self-\ndefeating over the years.\nThe investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their\nprices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by sizable\ndeclines nor become excited by sizable advances. He should\nalways remember that market quotations are there for his conve-\nnience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored. He should\nnever buy a stock because it has gone up or sell one because it has\ngone down. He would not be far wrong if this motto read more\nsimply: “Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or\nsell one immediately after a substantial drop.”\nAn Added Consideration\nSomething should be said about the significance of average mar-\nket prices as a measure of managerial competence. The shareholder\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 207\njudges whether his own investment has been successful in terms\nboth of dividends received and of the long-range trend of the aver-\nage market value. The same criteria should logically be applied in\ntesting the effectiveness of a company’s management and the\nsoundness of its attitude toward the owners of the business.\nThis statement may sound like a truism, but it needs to be\nemphasized. For as yet there is no accepted technique or approach\nby which management is brought to the bar of market opinion. On\nthe contrary, managements have always insisted that they have no\nresponsibility of any kind for what happens to the market value of\ntheir shares. It is true, of course, that they are not accountable for\nthosefluctuationsin price which, as we have been insisting, bear no\nrelationship to underlying conditions and values. But it is only the\nlack of alertness and intelligence among the rank and file of share-\nholders that permits this immunity to extend to the entire realm of\nmarket quotations, including the permanent establishment of a\ndepreciated and unsatisfactory price level. Good managements\nproduce a good average market price, and bad managements pro-\nduce bad market prices.*\nFluctuations in Bond Prices\nThe investor should be aware that even though safety of its prin-\ncipal and interest may be unquestioned, a long-term bond could\nvary widely in market price in response to changes in interest rates.\nIn Table 8-1 we give data for various years back to 1902 covering\nyields for high-grade corporate and tax-free issues. As individual\nillustrations we add the price fluctuations of two representative\nrailroad issues for a similar period. (These are the Atchison, Topeka\n& Santa Fe general mortgage 4s, due 1995, for generations one of\nour premier noncallable bond issues, and the Northern Pacific Ry.\n3s, due 2047—originally a 150-year maturity!—long a typical Baa-\nrated bond.)\nBecause of their inverse relationship the low yields correspond\nto the high prices and vice versa. The decline in the Northern\n*Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate gov-\nernance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.\nwww.fx1618.com208 The Intelligent Investor\nPacific 3s in 1940 represented mainly doubts as to the safety of the\nissue. It is extraordinary that the price recovered to an all-time high\nin the next few years, and then lost two-thirds of its price chiefly\nbecause of the rise in general interest rates. There have been star-\ntling variations, as well, in the price of even the highest-grade\nbonds in the past forty years.\nNote that bond prices do not fluctuate in the same (inverse) pro-\nportion as the calculated yields, because their fixed maturity value\nof 100% exerts a moderating influence. However, for very long\nmaturities, as in our Northern Pacific example, prices and yields\nchange at close to the same rate.\nSince 1964 record movements in both directionshave taken place\nin the high-grade bond market. Taking “prime municipals” (tax-\nfree) as an example, their yield more than doubled, from 3.2% in\nJanuary 1965 to 7% in June 1970. Their price index declined, corre-\nspondingly, from 110.8 to 67.5. In mid-1970 the yields on high-\ngrade long-term bonds were higher than at any time in the nearly\n200 years of this country’s economic history.* Twenty-five years earlier,\njust before our protracted bull market began, bond yields were at\ntheirlowestpoint in history; long-term municipals returned as little\nas 1%, and industrials gave 2.40% compared with the 41⁄ to 5% for-\n2\nmerly considered “normal.” Those of us with a long experience on\nWall Street had seen Newton’s law of “action and reaction, equal\nand opposite” work itself out repeatedly in the stock market—the\nmost noteworthy example being the rise in the DJIA from 64 in\n1921 to 381 in 1929, followed by a record collapse to 41 in 1932. But\nthis time the widest pendulum swings took place in the usually\nstaid and slow-moving array of high-grade bond prices and yields.\nMoral: Nothing important on Wall Street can be counted on to\noccur exactly in the same way as it happened before. This repre-\n*By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields on long-\nterm U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963. Since bond\nyields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that prices had\nrisen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were at their most\nexpensive and as their future returns were almost guaranteed to be low. This\nprovides another proof of Graham’s lesson that the intelligent investor must\nrefuse to make decisions based on market fluctuations.\nwww.fx1618.com0791–2091\n,seussI\ndnoB\nevitatneserpeR\nowT\nfo\nsecirP\nni\ndna\n,sdleiY\ndnoB\nni\nsnoitautculF\n1-8\nELBAT\nsecirP\ndnoB\nsdleiY\ndnoB\nP\n&\nS\n.caP\n.roN\n.F\n.S\n&\n.T\n.A\nP\n&\nS\nAAA\n7402\n,s3\n5991\n,s4\nslapicinuM\netisopmoC\n97\n⁄1501\nhgih\n5091\n%11.3\n%13.4\nwol\n2091\n2\n⁄194\n96\nwol\n0291\n82.5\n04.6\nhgih\n0291\n2 37\n501\nhgih\n0391\n09.3\n35.4\nwol\n8291\n⁄364\n57\nwol\n2391\n72.5\n25.5\nhgih\n2391\n4 ⁄158\n⁄1711\nhgih\n6391\n54.1\n44.2\nwol\n6491\n4\n4\n⁄113\n⁄199\nwol\n04–9391\n60.7\n44.8\nhgih\n0791\n2\n2\n⁄349\n141\nhgih\n6491\n53.5\n41.7\nesolc\n1791\n4 ⁄323\n15\nwol\n0791\n4 ⁄173\n46\nesolc\n1791\n4\nwww.fx1618.com210 The Intelligent Investor\nsents the first half of our favorite dictum: “The more it changes, the\nmore it’s the same thing.”\nIf it is virtually impossible to make worthwhile predictions\nabout the price movements of stocks, it is completely impossible to\ndo so for bonds.* In the old days, at least, one could often find a\nuseful clue to the coming end of a bull or bear market by studying\nthe prior action of bonds, but no similar clues were given to a com-\ning change in interest rates and bond prices. Hence the investor\nmust choose between long-term and short-term bond investments\non the basis chiefly of his personal preferences. If he wants to be\ncertain that the market values will not decrease, his best choices are\nprobably U.S. savings bonds, Series E or H, which were described\nabove, p. 93. Either issue will give him a 5% yield (after the first\nyear), the Series E for up to 55⁄ years, the Series H for up to ten\n6\nyears, with a guaranteed resale value of cost or better.\nIf the investor wants the 7.5% now available on good long-term\ncorporate bonds, or the 5.3% on tax-free municipals, he must be\nprepared to see them fluctuate in price. Banks and insurance com-\npanies have the privilege of valuing high-rated bonds of this type\non the mathematical basis of “amortized cost,” which disregards\nmarket prices; it would not be a bad idea for the individual\ninvestor to do something similar.\nThe price fluctuations of convertible bonds and preferred stocks\nare the resultant of three different factors: (1) variations in the\nprice of the related common stock, (2) variations in the credit\nstanding of the company, and (3) variations in general interest\nrates. A good many of the convertible issues have been sold by\ncompanies that have credit ratings well below the best.3 Some of\nthese were badly affected by the financial squeeze in 1970. As a\nresult, convertible issues as a whole have been subjected to triply\nunsettling influences in recent years, and price variations have\nbeen unusually wide. In the typical case, therefore, the investor\nwould delude himself if he expected to find in convertible issues\nthat ideal combination of the safety of a high-grade bond and price\n*An updated analysis for today’s readers, explaining recent yields and the\nwider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be found in the\ncommentary on Chapter 4.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and Market Fluctuations 211\nprotection plus a chance to benefit from an advance in the price of\nthe common.\nThis may be a good place to make a suggestion about the “long-\nterm bond of the future.” Why should not the effects of changing\ninterest rates be divided on some practical and equitable basis\nbetween the borrower and the lender? One possibility would be to\nsell long-term bonds with interest payments that vary with an\nappropriate index of the going rate. The main results of such an\narrangement would be: (1) the investor’s bond would always have\na principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit\nrating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered\non conventional new issues; (2) the corporation would have the\nadvantages of long-term debt—being spared problems and costs of\nfrequent renewals of refinancing—but its interest costs would\nchange from year to year.4\nOver the past decade the bond investor has been confronted by\nan increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability\nof principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term)\ninterest rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with\nconsiderable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his princi-\npal value? It would be good for most investors if they could\ncompromise between these extremes, and be assured that neither\ntheir interest return nor their principal value will fall below a\nstated minimum over, say, a 20-year period. This could be\narranged, without great difficulty, in an appropriate bond contract\nof a new form. Important note: In effect the U.S. government has\ndone a similar thing in its combination of the original savings-\nbonds contracts with their extensions at higher interest rates. The\nsuggestion we make here would cover a longer fixed investment\nperiod than the savings bonds, and would introduce more flexibil-\nity in the interest-rate provisions.*\nIt is hardly worthwhile to talk about nonconvertible preferred\nstocks, since their special tax status makes the safe ones much more\ndesirable holdings by corporations—e.g., insurance companies—\n*As mentioned in the commentary on Chapters 2 and 4, Treasury Inflation-\nProtected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version of what Gra-\nham is suggesting here.\nwww.fx1618.com212 The Intelligent Investor\nthan by individuals. The poorer-quality ones almost always fluctu-\nate over a wide range, percentagewise, not too differently from\ncommon stocks. We can offer no other useful remark about them.\nTable 16-2 below, p. 406, gives some information on the price\nchanges of lower-grade nonconvertible preferreds between Decem-\nber 1968 and December 1970. The average decline was 17%, against\n11.3% for the S & Pcomposite index of common stocks.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 8\nThe happiness of those who want to be popular depends on\nothers; the happiness of those who seek pleasure fluctuates\nwith moods outside their control; but the happiness of the wise\ngrows out of their own free acts.\n—Marcus Aurelius\nDR. JEKYLL AND MR. MARKET\nMost of the time, the market is mostly accurate in pricing most stocks.\nMillions of buyers and sellers haggling over price do a remarkably\ngood job of valuing companies—on average. But sometimes, the price\nis not right; occasionally, it is very wrong indeed. And at such times,\nyou need to understand Graham’s image of Mr. Market, probably\nthe most brilliant metaphor ever created for explaining how stocks\ncan become mispriced.1 The manic-depressive Mr. Market does not\nalways price stocks the way an appraiser or a private buyer would\nvalue a business. Instead, when stocks are going up, he happily pays\nmore than their objective value; and, when they are going down, he is\ndesperate to dump them for less than their true worth.\nIs Mr. Market still around? Is he still bipolar? You bet he is.\nOn March 17, 2000, the stock of Inktomi Corp. hit a new high of\n$231.625. Since they first came on the market in June 1998, shares\nin the Internet-searching software company had gained roughly\n1,900%. Just in the few weeks since December 1999, the stock had\nnearly tripled.\nWhat was going on at Inktomi the business that could make Inktomi\nthe stock so valuable? The answer seems obvious: phenomenally fast\n1See Graham’s text, pp. 204–205.\nwww.fx1618.com\n213214 Commentary on Chapter 8\ngrowth. In the three months ending in December 1999, Inktomi sold\n$36 million in products and services, more than it had in the entire\nyear ending in December 1998. If Inktomi could sustain its growth\nrate of the previous 12 months for just five more years, its revenues\nwould explode from $36 million a quarter to $5 billion a month. With\nsuch growth in sight, the faster the stock went up, the farther up it\nseemed certain to go.\nBut in his wild love affair with Inktomi’s stock, Mr. Market was over-\nlooking something about its business. The company was losing\nmoney—lots of it. It had lost $6 million in the most recent quarter, $24\nmillion in the 12 months before that, and $24 million in the year before\nthat. In its entire corporate lifetime, Inktomi had never made a dime in\nprofits. Yet, on March 17, 2000, Mr. Market valued this tiny business at\na total of $25 billion. (Yes, that’s billion,with a B.)\nAnd then Mr. Market went into a sudden, nightmarish depression.\nOn September 30, 2002, just two and a half years after hitting\n$231.625 per share, Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsing\nfrom a total market value of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Had\nInktomi’s business dried up? Not at all; over the previous 12 months,\nthe company had generated $113 million in revenues. So what had\nchanged? Only Mr. Market’s mood: In early 2000, investors were\nso wild about the Internet that they priced Inktomi’s shares at 250\ntimes the company’s revenues. Now, however, they would pay only\n0.35 times its revenues. Mr. Market had morphed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr.\nHyde and was ferociously trashing every stock that had made a fool\nout of him.\nBut Mr. Market was no more justified in his midnight rage than he\nhad been in his manic euphoria. On December 23, 2002, Yahoo! Inc.\nannounced that it would buy Inktomi for $1.65 per share. That was\nnearly seven times Inktomi’s stock price on September 30. History will\nprobably show that Yahoo! got a bargain. When Mr. Market makes\nstocks so cheap, it’s no wonder that entire companies get bought\nright out from under him.2\n2As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great Depres-\nsion caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the value of\ntheir cash and other liquid assets, making them “worth more dead than\nalive.”\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 8 215\nTHINK FOR YOURSELF\nWould you willingly allow a certifiable lunatic to come by at least five\ntimes a week to tell you that you should feel exactly the way he feels?\nWould you ever agree to be euphoric just because he is—or miserable\njust because he thinks you should be? Of course not. You’d insist on\nyour right to take control of your own emotional life, based on your\nexperiences and your beliefs. But, when it comes to their financial\nlives, millions of people let Mr. Market tell them how to feel and what to\ndo—despite the obvious fact that, from time to time, he can get nuttier\nthan a fruitcake.\nIn 1999, when Mr. Market was squealing with delight, American\nemployees directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their\n401(k) retirement plans. By 2002, after Mr. Market had spent three\nyears stuffing stocks into black garbage bags, the average contribu-\ntion rate had dropped by nearly one-quarter, to just 7%.3The cheaper\nstocks got, the less eager people became to buy them—because they\nwere imitating Mr. Market, instead of thinking for themselves.\nThe intelligent investor shouldn’t ignore Mr. Market entirely. Instead,\nyou should do business with him—but only to the extent that it serves\nyour interests. Mr. Market’s job is to provide you with prices; your job\nis to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You do not\nhave to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.\nBy refusing to let Mr. Market be your master, you transform him into\nyour servant. After all, even when he seems to be destroying values,\nhe is creating them elsewhere. In 1999, the Wilshire 5000 index—the\nbroadest measure of U.S. stock performance—gained 23.8%, pow-\nered by technology and telecommunications stocks. But 3,743 of the\n7,234 stocks in the Wilshire index went down in value even as the\naverage was rising. While those high-tech and telecom stocks were\nhotter than the hood of a race car on an August afternoon, thousands\nof “Old Economy” shares were frozen in the mud—getting cheaper and\ncheaper.\nThe stock of CMGI, an “incubator” or holding company for Internet\n3News release, The Spectrem Group, “Plan Sponsors Are Losing the Battle\nto Prevent Declining Participation and Deferrals into Defined Contribution\nPlans,” October 25, 2002.\nwww.fx1618.comsratS\not\nsreknitS\nmorF\n1-8\nERUGIF\neulav\nlaniF\n000,1$\nfo\ndetsevni\nnruteR\nlatoT\n9991/1/1\n2002\n1002\n0002\n9991\nssenisuB\nynapmoC\n823,1\n1.49\n3.91\n8.1\n7.34–\nsmrofinu\nlairtsudni\nacilegnA\n953,2\n0.64\n3.55\n2.91\n7.21–\ngnigakcap\ncitsalp\n&\nlatem\n.proC\nllaB\n715,1\n1.2\n2.66\n9.36\n5.54–\ndoof\ntsaf\nstnaruatseR\nnI-evirD\nsrekcehC\n674,1\n0.5\n1.14\n0.33\n1.52–\nreliater\ntnuocsid\nserotS\nralloD\nylimaF\n721,3\n2.11\n3.24\n1.631\n3.61–\ntnempiuqe\ngnilbmag\nygolonhceT\nemaG\nlanoitanretnI\n492,1\n3.62\n0.83\n9.12\n1.93–\ngnikcurt\nnoitatropsnarT\ntnuH\nB\nJ\n566,2\n6.102\n1.75\n0.05\n5.26–\nlerappa\nsreihtolC\nknaB\n.A\n.soJ\n354,1\n7.42\n0.93\n0.85\n9.64–\necapsorea\n&\nesnefed\nnitraMdeehkcoL\n950,2\n3.01\n5.07\n9.36\n2.33–\nsgnihsinruf\nemoh\nstropmI\n1\nreiP\n142,1\n0.1\n2.23\n6.12\n5.32–\noccabot\nffuns\n.cnI\nTSU\n513\n0.54–\n2.64–\n5.55–\n1.931\nxednI\ntenretnI\nerihsliW\n877\n8.02–\n0.11–\n9.01–\n8.32\n)tekram\nkcots\nlatot(\nxedni\n0005\nerihsliW\nmoc.erihsliw.www\n;.P.L\n,zitrO\n+\nnosnhoJ\n+\nnosnorA\n:secruoS\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 8 217\nstart-up firms, went up an astonishing 939.9% in 1999.

He\nmeans that the intelligent individual investor has the full freedom to\nchoose whether or not to follow Mr. Market. You have the luxury of\nbeing able to think for yourself.5\n4A few months later, on March 10, 2000—the very day that NASDAQ hit its all-\ntime high—online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he had “repeat-\nedly” been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway short, a bet that\nBuffett’s stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar thrust of his rhetorical pelvis,\nCramer even declared that Berkshire’s shares were “ripe for the banging.” That\nsame day, market strategist Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked,\n“Norfolk Southern or Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?”\nCisco, a key to tomorrow’s Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over\nNorfolk Southern, part of yesterday’s railroad system.

Here are some of the handicaps mutual-\nfund managers and other professional investors are saddled with:\n• With billions of dollars under management, they must gravitate\ntoward the biggest stocks—the only ones they can buy in the\nmultimillion-dollar quantities they need to fill their portfolios. Thus\nmany funds end up owning the same few overpriced giants.\n• Investors tend to pour more money into funds as the market rises.\nThe managers use that new cash to buy more of the stocks they\nalready own, driving prices to even more dangerous heights.\n• If fund investors ask for their money back when the market drops,\nthe managers may need to sell stocks to cash them out. Just as\nthe funds are forced to buy stocks at inflated prices in a rising\nmarket, they become forced sellers as stocks get cheap again.\n• Many portfolio managers get bonuses for beating the market, so\nthey obsessively measure their returns against benchmarks like\nthe S & P 500 index. If a company gets added to an index, hun-\ndreds of funds compulsively buy it. (If they don’t, and that stock\nthen does well, the managers look foolish; on the other hand, if\nthey buy it and it does poorly, no one will blame them.)\n• Increasingly, fund managers are expected to specialize. Just as in\nmedicine the general practitioner has given way to the pediatric\nallergist and the geriatric otolaryngologist, fund managers must\nbuy only “small growth” stocks, or only “mid-sized value” stocks,\nor nothing but “large blend” stocks.6If a company gets too big, or\ntoo small, or too cheap, or an itty bit too expensive, the fund has\nto sell it—even if the manager loves the stock.\nSo there’s no reason you can’t do as well as the pros. What you\ncannot do (despite all the pundits who say you can) is to “beat the\npros at their own game.” The pros can’t even win their own game!\nWhy should you want to play it at all? If you follow their rules, you will\nlose—since you will end up as much a slave to Mr. Market as the pro-\nfessionals are.\n6Never mind what these terms mean, or are supposed to mean.

You can’t control whether the stocks or funds you buy\nwill outperform the market today, next week, this month, or this year; in\nthe short run, your returns will always be hostage to Mr. Market and\nhis whims. But you cancontrol:\n• your brokerage costs,by trading rarely, patiently, and cheaply\n• your ownership costs, by refusing to buy mutual funds with\nexcessive annual expenses\n• your expectations,by using realism, not fantasy, to forecast your\nreturns7\n• your risk, by deciding how much of your total assets to put at\nhazard in the stock market, by diversifying, and by rebalancing\n• your tax bills, by holding stocks for at least one year and, when-\never possible, for at least five years, to lower your capital-gains lia-\nbility\n• and, most of all, your own behavior.\nIf you listen to financial TV, or read most market columnists, you’d\nthink that investing is some kind of sport, or a war, or a struggle for\nsurvival in a hostile wilderness. But investing isn’t about beating oth-\ners at their game. It’s about controlling yourself at your own game.\nThe challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find the stocks that\nwill go up the most and down the least, but rather to prevent yourself\nfrom being your own worst enemy—from buying high just because Mr.\nMarket says “Buy!” and from selling low just because Mr. Market says\n“Sell!”\nIf you investment horizon is long—at least 25 or 30 years—there is\nonly one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and\nwhenever else you can spare some money.

You’re\nnot one penny poorer if someone in Dubuque or Dallas or Denver\n7See the brilliant column by Walter Updegrave, “Keep It Real,” Money,Feb-\nruary,w 20w02w, p.fpx. 5136–5168. .com220 Commentary on Chapter 8\nbeats the S & P 500 and you don’t. No one’s gravestone reads “HE\nBEAT THE MARKET.”\nI once interviewed a group of retirees in Boca Raton, one of\nFlorida’s wealthiest retirement communities. I asked these people—\nmostly in their seventies—if they had beaten the market over their\ninvesting lifetimes. Some said yes, some said no; most weren’t sure.\nThen one man said, “Who cares? All I know is, my investments earned\nenough for me to end up in Boca.”\nCould there be a more perfect answer? After all, the whole point of\ninvesting is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough\nmoney to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your invest-\ning success is not by whether you’re beating the market but by\nwhether you’ve put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline\nthat are likely to get you where you want to go. In the end, what mat-\nters isn’t crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making\nsure that you do cross it.8\nYOUR MONEY AND YOUR BRAIN\nWhy,then, do investors find Mr. Market so seductive? It turns out that\nour brains are hardwired to get us into investing trouble; humans are\npattern-seeking animals. Psychologists have shown that if you present\npeople with a random sequence—and tell them that it’s unpre-\ndictable—they will nevertheless insist on trying to guess what’s coming\nnext. Likewise, we “know” that the next roll of the dice will be a seven,\nthat a baseball player is due for a base hit, that the next winning num-\nber in the Powerball lottery will definitely be 4-27-9-16-42-10—and\nthat this hot little stock is the next Microsoft.\nGroundbreaking new research in neuroscience shows that our\nbrains are designed to perceive trends even where they might not\nexist. After an event occurs just two or three times in a row, regions of\nthe human brain called the anterior cingulate and nucleus accumbens\nautomatically anticipate that it will happen again. If it does repeat, a\nnatural chemical called dopamine is released, flooding your brain with\na soft euphoria. Thus, if a stock goes up a few times in a row, you\nreflexively expect it to keep going—and your brain chemistry changes\n8See Jason Zweig, “Did You Beat the Market?” Money,January, 2000, pp.\n55–58. www.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 8 221\nas the stock rises, giving you a “natural high.” You effectively become\naddicted to your own predictions.\nBut when stocks drop, that financial loss fires up your amygdala—\nthe part of the brain that processes fear and anxiety and generates the\nfamous “fight or flight” response that is common to all cornered ani-\nmals. Just as you can’t keep your heart rate from rising if a fire alarm\ngoes off, just as you can’t avoid flinching if a rattlesnake slithers onto\nyour hiking path, you can’t help feeling fearful when stock prices are\nplunging.9\nIn fact, the brilliant psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tver-\nsky have shown that the pain of financial loss is more than twice as\nintense as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. Making $1,000 on a\nstock feels great—but a $1,000 loss wields an emotional wallop more\nthan twice as powerful. Losing money is so painful that many people,\nterrified at the prospect of any further loss, sell out near the bottom or\nrefuse to buy more.\nThat helps explain why we fixate on the raw magnitude of a market\ndecline and forget to put the loss in proportion. So, if a TV reporter\nhollers, “The market is plunging—the Dow is down 100 points!” most\npeople instinctively shudder. But, at the Dow’s recent level of 8,000,\nthat’s a drop of just 1.2%. Now think how ridiculous it would sound if,\non a day when it’s 81 degrees outside, the TV weatherman shrieked,\n“The temperature is plunging—it’s dropped from 81 degrees to 80\ndegrees!” That, too, is a 1.2% drop. When you forget to view chang-\ning market prices in percentage terms, it’s all too easy to panic over\nminor vibrations. (If you have decades of investing ahead of you,\nthere’s a better way to visualize the financial news broadcasts; see the\nsidebar on p. 222.)\nIn the late 1990s, many people came to feel that they were in the\ndark unless they checked the prices of their stocks several times a\nday.

On\nBGFN, the audio doesn’t capture that famous sour clang of the\nmarket’s closing bell; the video doesn’t home in on brokers\nscurrying across the floor of the stock exchange like angry\nrodents. Nor does BGFN run any footage of investors gasping\non frozen sidewalks as red arrows whiz overhead on electronic\nstock tickers.\nInstead, the image that fills your TV screen is the facade of\nthe New York Stock Exchange, festooned with a huge banner\nreading: “SALE! 50% OFF!” As intro music, Bachman-Turner\nOverdrive can be heard blaring a few bars of their old barn-\nburner, “You Ain’t Seen Nothin’ Yet.” Then the anchorman\nannounces brightly, “Stocks became more attractive yet again\ntoday, as the Dow dropped another2.5% on heavy volume—the\nfourth day in a row that stocks have gotten cheaper. Tech\ninvestors fared even better,as leading companies like Microsoft\nlost nearly 5% on the day, making them even more affordable.\nThat comes on top of the good news of the past year, in which\nstocks have alreadylost50%,putting them at bargainlevels not\nseen in years. And some prominent analysts are optimistic that\nprices may drop still furtherin the weeks and months to come.”\nThe newscast cuts over to market strategist Ignatz Anderson\nof the Wall Street firm of Ketchum & Skinner, who says, “My\nforecast is for stocks to lose another 15% by June.

Did I call back at 1:37 P.M.?\n• If I had, would the price have changed? If it did, would I have\nrushed to sell my house?\n• By not checking, or even knowing, the market price of my house\nfrom minute to minute, do I prevent its value from rising over time?10\nThe only possible answer to these questions is of course not!And\nyou should view your portfolio the same way. Over a 10- or 20- or 30-\nyear investment horizon, Mr. Market’s daily dipsy-doodles simply do not\nmatter. In any case, for anyone who will be investing for years to come,\nfalling stock prices are good news, not bad, since they enable you to\nbuy more for less money. The longer and further stocks fall, and the\nmore steadily you keep buying as they drop, the more money you will\nmake in the end—ifyou remain steadfast until the end. Instead of fear-\ning a bear market, you should embrace it. The intelligent investor\nshould be perfectly comfortable owning a stock or mutual fund even if\nthe stock market stopped supplying daily prices for the next 10 years.11\nParadoxically, “you will be much more in control,” explains neurosci-\nentist Antonio Damasio, “if you realize how much you are not in con-\ntrol.” By acknowledging your biological tendency to buy high and sell\nlow, you can admit the need to dollar-cost average, rebalance, and\nsign an investment contract. By putting much of your portfolio on per-\nmanent autopilot, you can fight the prediction addiction, focus on your\nlong-term financial goals, and tune out Mr. Market’s mood swings.\n10It’s also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your house if its\nmarket price was reported to the last penny every day in the newspapers\nand on TV.\n11In a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s, a psychologist at\nColumbia and Harvard, Paul Andreassen, showed that investors who\nreceived frequent news updates on their stocks earned half the returns of\ninvestors who got no news at all. See Jason Zweig, “Here’s How to Use the\nNews and Tune Out the Noise,” Money,July, 1998, pp. 63–64.\nwww.fx1618.com224 Commentary on Chapter 8\nWHEN MR. MARKET GIVES YOU LEMONS,\nMAKE LEMONADE\nAlthough Graham teaches that you should buy when Mr. Market is\nyelling “sell,” there’s one exception the intelligent investor needs to\nunderstand. Selling into a bear market can make sense if it creates a\ntax windfall. The U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows you to use your\nrealized losses (any declines in value that you lock in by selling your\nshares) to offset up to $3,000 in ordinary income.12 Let’s say you\nbought 200 shares of Coca-Cola stock in January 2000 for $60 a\nshare—a total investment of $12,000. By year-end 2002, the stock\nwas down to $44 a share, or $8,800 for your lot—a loss of $3,200.\nYou could have done what most people do—either whine about\nyour loss, or sweep it under the rug and pretend it never happened.\nOr you could have taken control. Before 2002 ended, you could have\nsold all your Coke shares, locking in the $3,200 loss. Then, after wait-\ning 31 days to comply with IRS rules, you would buy 200 shares of\nCoke all over again. The result: You would be able to reduce your tax-\nable income by $3,000 in 2002, and you could use the remaining\n$200 loss to offset your income in 2003. And better yet, you would\nstill own a company whose future you believe in—but now you would\nown it for almost one-third less than you paid the first time.13\nWith Uncle Sam subsidizing your losses, it can make sense to sell\nand lock in a loss. If Uncle Sam wants to make Mr. Market look logical\nby comparison, who are we to complain?\n12Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of Coca-Cola\nstock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax code as it stood\nin early 2003.\n13This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital gains in\n2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends. Tax swaps are not to be\nundertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before doing a tax\nswap, read IRS Publication 550 (www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf).

Those that are redeemable on\ndemand by the holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as\n“mutual funds” (or “open-end funds”). Most of these are actively\nselling additional shares through a corps of salesmen. Those with\nnonredeemable shares are called “closed-end” companies or funds;\nthe number of their shares remains relatively constant. All of the\nfunds of any importance are registered with the Securities &\nExchange Commission (SEC), and are subject to its regulations and\ncontrols.*\nThe industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were\n383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6 bil-\nlions. Of these 356 companies, with $50.6 billions, were mutual\nfunds, and 27 companies with $4.0 billions, were closed-end.†\nThere are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the\nbroad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they\nhave a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds,\nor “stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks.\n(There are some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge\n*It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end\nfund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public unless it has\n“registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with the SEC.\n†The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At year-end\n2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding $6.56 trillion; 514 closed-end\nfunds with $149.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade funds or ETFs\nwith $109.7 billion. These figures exclude such fund-like investments as\nvariable annuities and unit investment trusts.\nwww.fx1618.com\n226Investing in Investment Funds 227\nfunds,” “letter-stock funds,” etc.)* Another is by their objectives, as\ntheir primary aim is for income, price stability, or capital apprecia-\ntion (“growth”). Another distinction is by their method of sale.\n“Load funds” add a selling charge (generally about 9% of asset\nvalue on minimum purchases) to the value before charge.1Others,\nknown as “no-load” funds, make no such charge; the manage-\nments are content with the usual investment-counsel fees for han-\ndling the capital. Since they cannot pay salesmen’s commissions,\nthe size of the no-load funds tends to be on the low side.† The buy-\ning and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not fixed by the\ncompanies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the ordinary\ncorporate stock.\nMost of the companies operate under special provisions of the\nincome-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double\ntaxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out vir-\ntually all their ordinary income—i.e., dividends and interest\nreceived, less expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized\nlong-term profits on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-\ngains dividends”—which are treated by the shareholder as if they\nwere his own security profits. (There is another option here, which\nwe omit to avoid clutter.)‡ Nearly all the funds have but one class\n*Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at www.ici.org/\npdf/g2understanding.pdf and http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/\nCategoryReturns.html. Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds\nare generally banned by SEC rules from selling shares to any investor\nwhose annual income is below $200,000 or whose net worth is below $1\nmillion.\n†Today, the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around 5.75%.\nIf you invest $10,000 in a fund with a flat 5.75% sales load, $575 will go to\nthe person (and brokerage firm) that sold it to you, leaving you with an initial\nnet investment of $9,425. The $575 sales charge is actually 6.1% of that\namount, which is why Graham calls the standard way of calculating the\ncharge a “sales gimmick.” Since the 1980s, no-load funds have become\npopular, and they no longer tend to be smaller than load funds.\n‡Nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a “regulated investment company,”\nor RIC, which is exempt from corporate income tax so long as it\npays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders. In the “option” that\nwww.fx1618.com228 The Intelligent Investor\nof security outstanding. Anew wrinkle, introduced in 1967, divides\nthe capitalization into a preferred issue, which will receive all the\nordinary income, and a capital issue, or common stock, which will\nreceive all the profits on security sales. (These are called “dual-\npurpose funds.”)*\nMany of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital\ngains concentrate on the purchase of the so-called “growth stocks,”\nand they often have the word “growth” in their name. Some spe-\ncialize in a designated area such as chemicals, aviation, overseas\ninvestments; this is usually indicated in their titles.\nThe investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in\nfund shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of\nchoices before him—not too different from those offered in direct\ninvestment. In this chapter we shall deal with some major ques-\ntions, viz:\n1. Is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of\nbetter than average results by choosing the right funds? (Subques-\ntion: What about the “performance funds”?)†\n2. If not, how can he avoid choosing funds that will give him\nworse than average results?\n3. Can he make intelligent choices between different types of\nfunds—e.g., balanced versus all-stock, open-end versus closed-\nend, load versus no-load?\nGraham omits “to avoid clutter,” a fund can ask the SEC for special permis-\nsion to distribute one of its holdings directly to the fund’s shareholders—as\nhis Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling out shares in GEICO to\nGraham-Newman’s own investors. This sort of distribution is extraordinarily rare.\n*Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially disap-\npeared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a more\nflexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers like John\nNeff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a renaissance of this\nattractive investment vehicle.\n†“Performance funds” were all the rage in the late 1960s. They were equiv-\nalent to the aggressive growth funds of the late 1990s, and served their\ninvestors no better.\nwww.fx1618.comInvesting in Investment Funds 229\nInvestment-Fund Performance as a Whole\nBefore trying to answer these questions we should say some-\nthing about the performance of the fund industry as a whole. Has\nit done a good job for its shareholders? In the most general way,\nhow have fund investors fared as against those who made their\ninvestments directly? We are quite certain that the funds in the\naggregate have served a useful purpose. They have promoted\ngood habits of savings and investment; they have protected count-\nless individuals against costly mistakes in the stock market; they\nhave brought their participants income and profits commensurate\nwith the overall returns from common stocks. On a comparative\nbasis we would hazard the guess that the average individual who\nput his money exclusively in investment-fund shares in the past\nten years has fared better than the average person who made his\ncommon-stock purchases directly.\nThe last point is probably true even though the actual perfor-\nmance of the funds seems to have been no better than that of com-\nmon stocks as a whole, and even though the cost of investing in\nmutual funds may have been greater than that of direct purchases.\nThe real choice of the average individual has not been between\nconstructing and acquiring a well-balanced common-stock portfo-\nlio or doing the same thing, a bit more expensively, by buying into\nthe funds. More likely his choice has been between succumbing to\nthe wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund salesman on the one\nhand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and much more\ndangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings. We\ncannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a\nbrokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-\nstock investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influ-\nences in the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these\ntemptations should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.\nBut how have the investment funds performed as against the\ngeneral market? This is a somewhat controversial subject, but we\nshall try to deal with it in simple but adequate fashion.

We also give average results based on the sum of\none share of each of the ten funds. These companies had combined\nassets of over $15 billion at the end of 1969, or about one-third of all\nthe common-stock funds. Thus they should be fairly representative\nof the industry as a whole. (In theory, there should be a bias in this\nlist on the side of better than industry performance, since these bet-\nter companies should have been entitled to more rapid expansion\nthan the others; but this may not be the case in practice.)\nSome interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we\nfind that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were\nnot appreciably different from those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock composite average (or the S & P 425-industrial stock aver-\nage). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA. (This\nraises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA\ndid worse than the much more numerous and apparently rather\nmiscellaneous list used by Standard & Poor’s.)* Asecond point is\nthat the funds’ aggregate performance as against the S & P index\nhas improved somewhat in the last five years, compared with the\npreceding five. The funds’ gain ran a little lower than S & P’s in\n1961–1965 and a little higher than S & P’s in 1966–1970. The third\npoint is that a wide difference exists between the results of the indi-\nvidual funds.\nWe do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for\ndoing no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and\ntheir professional competitors administer so large a portion of all\nmarketable common stocks that what happens to the market as a\nwhole must necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their\nfunds. (Note that the trust assets of insured commercial banks\nincluded $181 billion of common stocks at the end of 1969; if we\nadd to this the common stocks in accounts handled by investment\nadvisers, plus the $56 billion of mutual and similar funds, we must\nconclude that the combined decisions of these professionals pretty\nwell determine the movements of the stock averages, and that the\n*For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S & P 500\ncan diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course of the typical investing\nlifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their returns have tended to converge\nquite closely.\nwww.fx1618.com232 The Intelligent Investor\nmovement of the stock averages pretty well determines the funds’\naggregate results.)\nAre there better than average funds and can the investor select\nthese so as to obtain superior results for himself? Obviously all\ninvestors could not do this, since in that case we would soon be\nback where we started, with no one doing better than anyone else.\nLet us consider the question first in a simplified fashion. Why\nshouldn’t the investor find out what fund has made the best show-\ning of the lot over a period of sufficient years in the past, assume\nfrom this that its management is the most capable and will there-\nfore do better than average in the future, and put his money in that\nfund? This idea appears the more practicable because, in the case\nof the mutual funds, he could obtain this “most capable manage-\nment” without paying any special premium for it as against the\nother funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment corporations the\nbest-managed companies sell at correspondingly high prices in\nrelation to their current earnings and assets.)\nThe evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years.\nBut our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the\nresults shown by the top five performers of 1961–1965 carried over\non the wholethrough 1966–1970, even though two of this set did not\ndo as well as two of the other five. Our studies indicate that the\ninvestor in mutual-fund shares may properly consider compara-\ntive performance over a period of years in the past, say at least five,\nprovidedthe data do not represent a large net upward movement of\nthe market as a whole. In the latter case spectacularly favorable\nresults may be achieved in unorthodox ways—as will be demon-\nstrated in our following section on “performance” funds. Such\nresults in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are\ntaking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the\ntime being.\n“Performance” Funds\nOne of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance\nof the cult of “performance” in the management of investment\nfunds (and even of many trust funds). We must start this section\nwith the important disclaimer that it does not apply to the large\nmajority of well-established funds, but only to a relatively small\nwww.fx1618.comInvesting in Investment Funds 233\nsection of the industry which has attracted a disproportionate\namount of attention. The story is simple enough. Some of those in\ncharge set out to get much better than average (or DJIA) results.\nThey succeeded in doing this for a while, garnering considerable\npublicity and additional funds to manage. The aim was legitimate\nenough; unfortunately, it appears that, in the context of investing\nreally sizable funds, the aim cannot be accomplished without\nincurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively short time the risks\ncame home to roost.\nSeveral of the circumstances surrounding the “performance”\nphenomenon caused ominous headshaking by those of us whose\nexperience went far back—even to the 1920s—and whose views,\nfor that very reason, were considered old-fashioned and irrelevant\nto this (second) “New Era.” In the first place, and on this very\npoint, nearly all these brilliant performers were young men—in\ntheir thirties and forties—whose direct financial experience was\nlimited to the all but continuous bull market of 1948–1968. Sec-\nondly, they often acted as if the definition of a “sound investment”\nwas a stock that was likely to have a good rise in the market in the\nnext few months. This led to large commitments in newer ventures\nat prices completely disproportionate to their assets or recorded\nearnings. They could be “justified” only by a combination of naïve\nhope in the future accomplishments of these enterprises with an\napparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of\nthe uninformed and greedy public.\nThis section will not mention people’s names. But we have\nevery reason to give concrete examples of companies. The “perfor-\nmance fund” most in the public’s eye was undoubtedly Manhattan\nFund, Inc., organized at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27\nmillion shares at $9.25 to $10 per share. The company started out\nwith $247 million of capital. Its emphasis was, of course, on capital\ngains. Most of its funds were invested in issues selling at high mul-\ntipliers of current earnings, paying no dividends (or very small\nones), with a large speculative following and spectacular price\nmovements. The fund showed an overall gain of 38.6% in 1967,\nagainst 11% for the S & Pcomposite index. But thereafter its perfor-\nmance left much to be desired, as is shown in Table 9-2.\nwww.fx1618.com234 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 9-2 APerformance-Fund Portfolio and Performance\n(Larger Holdings of Manhattan Fund, December 31, 1969)\nShares Market\nHeld Earned Dividend Value\n(thousands) Issue Price 1969 1969 (millions)\n60 Teleprompter 99 $ .99 none $ 6.0\n190 Deltona 601⁄ 2.32 none 11.5\n2\n280 Fedders 34 1.28 $ .35 9.5\n105 Horizon Corp. 531⁄ 2.68 none 5.6\n2\n150 Rouse Co. 34 .07 none 5.1\n130 Mattel Inc. 641⁄ 1.11 .20 8.4\n4\n120 Polaroid 125 1.90 .32 15.0\n244a Nat’l Student Mkt’g 281⁄ .32 none 6.1\n2\n56 Telex Corp. 901⁄ .68 none 5.0\n2\n100 Bausch & Lomb 773⁄ 1.92 .80 7.8\n4\n190 Four Seasons Nursing 66 .80 none 12.3b\n20 Int.

It is an extraordinary fact that two of\nits largest investments were in companies that filed for bankruptcy\nwithin six months thereafter, and a third faced creditors’ actions in\n1971. It is another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of\nthese doomed companies were bought not only by investment\nfunds but by university endowment funds, the trust departments\nof large banking institutions, and the like.* A third extraordinary\nfact was that the founder-manager of Manhattan Fund sold his\nstock in a separately organized management company to another\nlarge concern for over $20 million in its stock; at that time the man-\nagement company sold had less than $1 million in assets. This is\nundoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between the\nresults for the “manager” and the “managees.”\nAbook published at the end of 19692provided profiles of nine-\nteen men “who are tops at the demanding game of managing bil-\nlions of dollars of other people’s money.” The summary told us\nfurther that “they are young...some earn more than a million dol-\nlars a year...they are a new financial breed...they all have a\ntotal fascination with the market...and a spectacular knack for\ncoming up with winners.” A fairly good idea of the accomplish-\nments of this top group can be obtained by examining the pub-\nlished results of the funds they manage. Such results are available\nfor funds directed by twelve of the nineteen persons described in\nThe Money Managers. Typically enough, they showed up well in\n1966, and brilliantly in 1967. In 1968 their performance was still\ngood in the aggregate, but mixed as to individual funds. In 1969\nthey all showed losses, with only one managing to do a bit better\nthan the S & Pcomposite index. In 1970 their comparative perfor-\nmance was even worse than in 1969.\n*One of the “doomed companies” Graham refers to was National Student\nMarketing Corp., a con game masquerading as a stock, whose saga was\ntold brilliantly in Andrew Tobias’s The Funny Money Game(Playboy Press,\nNew York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who were\nsnookered by NSM’s charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the endow-\nment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such presti-\ngious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.\nwww.fx1618.com236 The Intelligent Investor\nWehave presented this picture in order to point a moral, which\nperhaps can best be expressed by the old French proverb: Plus ça\nchange, plus c’est la même chose. Bright, energetic people—usually\nquite young—have promised to perform miracles with “other\npeople’s money” since time immemorial. They have usually been\nable to do it for a while—or at least to appear to have done it—and\nthey have inevitably brought losses to their public in the end.*\nAbout a half century ago the “miracles” were often accompanied\nby flagrant manipulation, misleading corporate reporting, outra-\ngeous capitalization structures, and other semifraudulent financial\npractices. All this brought on an elaborate system of financial con-\ntrols by the SEC, as well as a cautious attitude toward common\nstocks on the part of the general public. The operations of the new\n“money managers” in 1965–1969 came a little more than one full\ngeneration after the shenanigans of 1926–1929.† The specific mal-\npractices banned after the 1929 crash were no longer resorted to—\nthey involved the risk of jail sentences. But in many corners of Wall\nStreet they were replaced by newer gadgets and gimmicks that\nproduced very similar results in the end. Outright manipulation of\nprices disappeared, but there were many other methods of draw-\ning the gullible public’s attention to the profit possibilities in “hot”\nissues. Blocks of “letter stock”3 could be bought well below the\nquoted market price, subject to undisclosed restrictions on their\nsale; they could immediately be carried in the reports at their full\nmarket value, showing a lovely and illusory profit. And so on. It is\n*As only the latest proof that “the more things change, the more they stay\nthe same,” consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder, launched\nthe Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a 216% return at\nhis previous dot-com fund. Investors poured nearly $300 million into\nJacob’s fund in the first few weeks of 2000. It then proceeded to lose\n79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002—a cumulative collapse of\n92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s investors even older and wiser\nthan it made him.\n†Intriguingly, the disastrous boom and bust of 1999–2002 also came\nroughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes about\n35 years for the investors who remember the last “New Economy” craze to\nbecome less influential than those who do not.

But it is probably too much to expect that\nthe urge to speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of\nthat urge can ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the\nintelligent investor to know about these “Extraordinary Popular\nDelusions,”4and to keep as far away from them as possible.\nThe picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we\nstart after their spectacular record in 1967. With the 1967 figures\nincluded, their overall showing is not at all disastrous. On that\nbasis one of “The Money Managers” operators did quite a bit better\nthan the S & Pcomposite index, three did distinctly worse, and six\ndid about the same. Let us take as a check another group of perfor-\nmance funds—the ten that made the best showing in 1967, with\ngains ranging from 84% up to 301% in that single year. Of these,\nfour gave a better overall four-year performance than the S & P\nindex, if the 1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in\n1968–1970. None of these funds was large, and the average size\nwas about $60 million. Thus, there is a strong indication that\nsmaller size is a necessary factor for obtaining continued outstand-\ning results.\nThe foregoing account contains the implicit conclusion that\nthere may be special risks involved in looking for superior perfor-\nmance by investment-fund managers. All financial experience up\nto now indicates that large funds, soundly managed, can produce\nat best only slightly better than average results over the years. If\nthey are unsoundly managed they can produce spectacular, but\nlargely illusory, profits for a while, followed inevitably by calami-\ntous losses. There have been instances of funds that have consis-\ntently outperformed the market averages for, say, ten years or\nmore. But these have been scarce exceptions, having most of their\noperations in specialized fields, with self-imposed limits on the\ncapital employed—and not actively sold to the public.*\n*Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be open-end\nfundsw thwatw ar.ef xcl1os6e1d 8to. cneowm investors—meaning that the managers have238 The Intelligent Investor\nClosed-End versus Open-End Funds\nAlmost all the mutual funds or open-end funds, which offer\ntheir holders the right to cash in their shares at each day’s valua-\ntion of the portfolio, have a corresponding machinery for selling\nnew shares. By this means most of them have grown in size over\nthe years. The closed-end companies, nearly all of which were\norganized a long time ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus\nhave diminished in relative dollar importance. Open-end compa-\nnies are being sold by many thousands of energetic and persuasive\nsalesmen, the closed-end shares have no one especially interested\nin distributing them. Consequently it has been possible to sell most\n“mutual funds” to the public at a fixed premium of about 9%\nabove net asset value (to cover salesmen’s commissions, etc.),\nwhile the majority of close-end shares have been consistently\nobtainable at lessthan their asset value. This price discount has var-\nied among individual companies, and the average discount for the\ngroup as a whole has also varied from one date to another. Figures\non this point for 1961–1970 are given in Table 9-3.\nIt does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower rela-\ntive price for closed-end as against open-end shares has very little\nto do with the difference in the overall investment results between\nthe two groups. That this is true is indicated by the comparison of\nthe annual results for 1961–1970 of the two groups included in\nTable 9-3.\nThus we arrive at one of the few clearly evident rules for\ninvestors’ choices. If you want to put money in investment funds,\nbuy a group of closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15%\nfrom asset value, instead of paying a premium of about 9% above\nasset value for shares of an open-end company. Assuming that the\nfuture dividends and changes in asset values continue to be about\nthe same for the two groups, you will thus obtain about one-fifth\nmore for your money from the closed-end shares.\nThe mutual-fund salesman will be quick to counter with the\nstopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the management fees\nthey can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing shareholders can earn.\nBecause most fund managers would rather look out for No. 1 than be No. 1,\nclosing aw fuwndw to. nfxew1 i6nv1es8to.rcs ois ma rare and courageous step.Investing in Investment Funds 239\nTABLE 9-3 Certain Data on Closed-End Funds, Mutual\nFunds, and S & P Composite Index\nAverage\nAverage Average Results\nDiscount Results of Results\nof of Mutual of\nClosed-End Closed-End Stock S & P\nYear Funds Fundsa Fundsb Indexc\n1970 – 6% even – 5.3% + 3.5%\n1969 – 7.9% –12.5 – 8.3\n1968 (+ 7)d +13.3 +15.4 +10.4\n1967 – 5 +28.2 +37.2 +23.0\n1966 –12 – 5.9 – 4.1 –10.1\n1965 –14 +14.0 +24.8 +12.2\n1964 –10 +16.9 +13.6 +14.8\n1963 – 8 +20.8 +19.3 +24.0\n1962 – 4 –11.6 –14.6 – 8.7\n1961 – 3 +23.6 +25.7 +27.0\nAverage of 10 yearly figures: + 9.14% + 9.95% + 9.79%\naWiesenberger average of ten diversified companies.\nbAverage of five Wiesenberger averages of common-stock funds each year.\ncIn all cases distributions are added back.\ndPremium.\nargument: “Ah, but if you own closed-end shares you can never be\nsure what price you can sell them for.

Investor A\nredeems his shares at 100% of value, losing the 9% premium he\npaid. His overall return for the period is 30% less 9%, or 21% on\nasset value. This, in turn, is 19% on his investment. How much\nmust Investor B realize on his closed-end shares to obtain the same\nreturn on his investment as Investor A? The answer is 73%, or a\ndiscount of 27% from asset value. In other words, the closed-end\nman could suffer a widening of 12 points in the market discount\n(about double) before his return would get down to that of the\nopen-end investor. An adverse change of this magnitude has hap-\npened rarely, if ever, in the history of closed-end shares. Hence it is\nvery unlikely that you will obtain a lower overall return from a\n(representative) closed-end company, bought at a discount, if its\ninvestment performance is about equal to that of a representative\nmutual fund. If a small-load (or no-load) fund is substituted for\none with the usual “81⁄%” load, the advantage of the closed-end\n2\ninvestment is of course reduced, but it remains an advantage.\nThe fact that a few closed-end funds are selling at premiums\ngreater than the true 9% charge on most mutual funds introduces a\nseparate question for the investor. Do these premium companies\nenjoy superior management of sufficient proven worth to warrant\ntheir elevated prices?

And why not? Psychologists\nhave shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the\nlong run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes.\nWhat’s more, we know from our own experience that some plumbers\nare far better than others, that some baseball players are much more\nlikely to hit home runs, that our favorite restaurant serves consistently\nsuperior food, and that smart kids get consistently good grades. Skill\nand brains and hard work are recognized, rewarded—and consistently\nrepeated—all around us. So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition\ntells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming.\nUnfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than\nskill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at\njust the right time, he will look brilliant—but all too often, what was hot\nsuddenly goes cold and the manager’s IQ seems to shrivel by 50\npoints.

When a fund earns high returns, investors\nnotice—often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of\nweeks. That leaves the fund manager with few choices—all of them\nbad. He can keep that money safe for a rainy day, but then the low\nreturns on cash will crimp the fund’s results if stocks keep going up.\nHe can put the new money into the stocks he already owns—which\nhave probably gone up since he first bought them and will become\ndangerously overvalued if he pumps in millions of dollars more. Or he\ncan buy new stocks he didn’t like well enough to own already—but he\nwill have to research them from scratch and keep an eye on far more\ncompanies than he is used to following.\nFinally, when the $100-million Nimble Fund puts 2% of its assets\n(or $2 million) in Minnow Corp., a stock with a total market value of\n$500 million, it’s buying up less than one-half of 1% of Minnow. But if\nhot performance swells the Nimble Fund to $10 billion, then an invest-\nment of 2% of its assets would total $200 million—nearly half the\nentire value of Minnow, a level of ownership that isn’t even permissible\nunder Federal law. If Nimble’s portfolio manager still wants to own\nsmall stocks, he will have to spread his money over vastly more com-\npanies—and probably end up spreading his attention too thin.\nNo more fancy footwork.Some companies specialize in “incubat-\ning” their funds—test-driving them privately before selling them pub-\nlicly. (Typically, the only shareholders are employees and affiliates of\nthe fund company itself.) By keeping them tiny, the sponsor can use\nthese incubated funds as guinea pigs for risky strategies that work\nbest with small sums of money, like buying truly tiny stocks or rapid-fire\ntrading of initial public offerings. If its strategy succeeds, the fund can\nlure public investors en masse by publicizing its private returns. In\nother cases, the fund manager “waives” (or skips charging) manage-\nment fees, raising the net return—then slaps the fees on later after the\nhigh returns attract plenty of customers. Almost without exception, the\nreturns of incubated and fee-waived funds have faded into mediocrity\nafter outside investors poured millions of dollars into them.\n3That’s not to say that these funds would have done better if their “super-\nstar” managers had stayed in place; all we can be sure of is that the two\nfunds didw pwoowrly .wfixth1ou6t 1th8em.c. omCommentary on Chapter 9 247\nRising expenses. It often costs more to trade stocks in very large\nblocks than in small ones; with fewer buyers and sellers, it’s harder to\nmake a match. A fund with $100 million in assets might pay 1% a year\nin trading costs. But, if high returns send the fund mushrooming up to\n$10 billion, its trades could easily eat up at least 2% of those assets.\nThe typical fund holds on to its stocks for only 11 months at a time, so\ntrading costs eat away at returns like a corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the\nother costs of running a fund rarely fall—and sometimes even rise—as\nassets grow. With operating expenses averaging 1.5%, and trading\ncosts at around 2%, the typical fund has to beat the market by 3.5\npercentage points per year before costs just to match it after costs!\nSheepish behavior. Finally, once a fund becomes successful, its\nmanagers tend to become timid and imitative. As a fund grows, its\nfees become more lucrative—making its managers reluctant to rock\nthe boat. The very risks that the managers took to generate their initial\nhigh returns could now drive investors away—and jeopardize all that fat\nfee income. So the biggest funds resemble a herd of identical and\noverfed sheep, all moving in sluggish lockstep, all saying “baaaa” at\nthe same time. Nearly every growth fund owns Cisco and GE and\nMicrosoft and Pfizer and Wal-Mart—and in almost identical propor-\ntions. This behavior is so prevalent that finance scholars simply call it\nherding.4But by protecting their own fee income, fund managers com-\npromise their ability to produce superior returns for their outside\ninvestors.\n4There’s a second lesson here: To succeed, the individual investor must\neither avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that have already\nbeen picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far more patiently.\nSee Erik R.

No wonder high returns are nearly as perishable as unre-\nfrigerated fish. What’s more, as time passes, the drag of their exces-\nsive expenses leaves most funds farther and farther behind, as Figure\n9.2 shows.5\nWhat, then, should the intelligent investor do?\nFirst of all, recognize that an index fund—which owns all the stocks\n5Amazingly, this illustration understatesthe advantage of index funds, since\nthe database from which it is taken does not include the track records of\nhundreds of funds that disappeared over these periods.

(If your company doesn’t offer a low-cost index fund in your\n401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its\nrock-bottom overhead—operating expenses of 0.2% annually, and\nyearly trading costs of just 0.1%—give the index fund an insurmount-\nable advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over\nthe next 20 years, a low-cost index fund like Vanguard Total Stock\nMarket will return just under 6.7%. (That would turn a $10,000 invest-\nment into more than $36,000.) But the average stock fund, with\nits 1.5% in operating expenses and roughly 2% in trading costs, will\nbe lucky to gain 3.5% annually. (That would turn $10,000 into just\nunder $20,000—or nearly 50% less than the result from the index\nfund.)\nIndex funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. You’ll\nnever be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the\ntop-performing fund in the country. You’ll never be able to boast that\nyou beat the market, because the job of an index fund is to match the\nmarket’s return, not to exceed it. Your index-fund manager is not likely\nto “roll the dice” and gamble that the next great industry will be tele-\nportation, or scratch-’n’-sniff websites, or telepathic weight-loss clin-\nics; the fund will always own every stock, not just one manager’s best\nguess at the next new thing. But, as the years pass, the cost advan-\ntage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly. Hold an index fund for\n20 years or more, adding new money every month, and you are all but\ncertain to outperform the vast majority of professional and individual\ninvestors alike. Late in his life, Graham praised index funds as the best\nchoice for individual investors, as does Warren Buffett.6\n6See Benjamin Graham, Benjamin Graham: Memoirs of the Dean of Wall\nStreet,Seymour Chatman, ed. (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996), p. 273, and\nJanet Lowe, The Rediscovered Benjamin Graham: Selected Writings of the\nWall Street Legend(John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999), p. 273. As War-\nren Buffett wrote in his 1996 annual report: “Most investors, both institu-\ntional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is\nthrough an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path\nare sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the\ngreat majority of investment professionals.” (See www.berkshirehathaway.\ncom/w19w96war/.1f9x9166.h1tm8l.).com250 Commentary on Chapter 9\nTILTING THE TABLES\nWhen you add up all their handicaps, the wonder is not that so few\nfunds beat the index, but that any do. And yet, some do. What quali-\nties do they have in common?\nTheir managers are the biggest shareholders. The conflict of\ninterest between what’s best for the fund’s managers and what’s best\nfor its investors is mitigated when the managers are among the\nbiggest owners of the fund’s shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Part-\nners, even forbid their employees from owning anything but their own\nfunds. At Longleaf and other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers\nown so much of the funds that they are likely to manage your money\nas if it were their own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let\nthe funds swell to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A\nfund’s proxy statement and Statement of Additional Information, both\navailable from the Securities and Exchange Commission through the\nEDGAR database at www.sec.gov, disclose whether the managers\nown at least 1% of the fund’s shares.\nThey are cheap.One of the most common myths in the fund busi-\nness is that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best\njustification for higher fees. There are two problems with this argu-\nment. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that funds\nwith higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high returns\nare temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If\nyou buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful\nof cold ashes—but your costs of owning the fund are almost certain\nnotto decline when its returns do.\nThey dare to be different.When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he\nbought whatever seemed cheap to him—regardless of what other fund\nmanagers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;\nright after that, he made Chrysler his top holding, even though most\nexperts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put\nalmost 20% of Fidelity Magellan in foreign stocks like Honda, Norsk\nHydro, and Volvo. So, before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the hold-\nings listed in its latest report against the roster of the S & P 500 index; if\nthey look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum, shop for another fund.7\n7A complete listing of the S & P 500’s constituent companies is available at\nwww.stawndwardwan.dfpxo1or6s.1co8m..comCommentary on Chapter 9 251\nThey shut the door.The best funds often close to new investors—\npermitting only their existing shareholders to buy more. That stops the\nfeeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top and pro-\ntects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis. It’s also a signal\nthat the fund managers are not putting their own wallets ahead of\nyours. But the closing should occur before—not after—the fund\nexplodes in size. Some companies with an exemplary record of shut-\nting their own gates are Longleaf, Numeric, Oakmark, T. Rowe Price,\nVanguard, and Wasatch.\nThey don’t advertise.Just as Plato says in The Republicthat the ideal\nrulers are those who do not want to govern, the best fund managers often\nbehave as if they don’t want your money. They don’t appear constantly on\nfinancial television or run ads boasting of their No. 1 returns. The steady lit-\ntle Mairs & Power Growth Fund didn’t even have a website until 2001 and\nstill sells its shares in only 24 states. The Torray Fund has never run a retail\nadvertisement since its launch in 1990.\nWhat else should you watch for? Most fund buyers look at past\nperformance first, then at the manager’s reputation, then at the riski-\nness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund’s expenses.8\nThe intelligent investor looks at those same things—but in the oppo-\nsite order.\nSince a fund’s expenses are far more predictable than its future risk\nor return, you should make them your first filter. There’s no good rea-\nson ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses,\nby fund category:\n• Taxable and municipal bonds: 0.75%\n• U.S. equities (large and mid-sized stocks): 1.0%\n• High-yield (junk) bonds: 1.0%\n8See Noel Capon, Gavan Fitzsimons, and Russ Alan Prince, “An Individual\nLevel Analysis of the Mutual Fund Investment Decision,” Journal of Finan-\ncial Services Research, vol. 10, 1996, pp. 59–82; Investment Company\nInstitute, “Understanding Shareholders’ Use of Information and Advisers,”\nSpring, 1997, at www.ici.org/pdf/rpt_undstnd_share.pdf, p. 21; Gordon\nAlexander, Jonathan Jones, and Peter Nigro, “Mutual Fund Shareholders:\nCharacteristics, Investor Knowledge, and Sources of Information,” OCC\nworking paper, December, 1997, at www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/workpaper/\nwp97w-1w3.pwdf..fx1618.com252 Commentary on Chapter 9\n• U.S. equities (small stocks): 1.25%\n• Foreign stocks: 1.50%9\nNext, evaluate risk. In its prospectus (or buyer’s guide), every fund\nmust show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quar-\nter. If you can’t stand losing at least that much money in three months,\ngo elsewhere. It’s also worth checking a fund’s Morningstar rating. A\nleading investment research firm, Morningstar awards “star ratings” to\nfunds, based on how much risk they took to earn their returns (one\nstar is the worst, five is the best). But, just like past performance itself,\nthese ratings look back in time; they tell you which funds were the\nbest, not which are going to be. Five-star funds, in fact, have a discon-\ncerting habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first find\na low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be\ndifferent, don’t hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to\nshut down before they get too big for their britches. Then, and only\nthen, consult their Morningstar rating.10\nFinally, look at past performance, remembering that it is only a pale\npredictor of future returns. As we’ve already seen, yesterday’s winners\noften become tomorrow’s losers. But researchers have shown that\none thing is almost certain: Yesterday’s losers almost never become\ntomorrow’s winners. So avoid funds with consistently poor past\nreturns—especially if they have above-average annual expenses.\nTHE CLOSED WORLD OF\nCLOSED-END FUNDS\nClosed-end stock funds, although popular during the 1980s, have\nslowly atrophied. Today, there are only 30 diversified domestic\n9Investors can search easily for funds that meet these expense hurdles by\nusing the fund-screening tools at www.morningstar.com and http://money.\ncnn.com.\n10See Matthew Morey, “Rating the Raters: An Investigation of Mutual Fund\nRating Services,” Journal of Investment Consulting,vol. 5, no. 2, November/\nDecember, 2002. While its star ratings are a weak predictor of future\nresults, Morningstar is the single best source of information on funds for\nindividual investors.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 9 253\nequity funds, many of them tiny, trading only a few hundred shares\na day, with high expenses and weird strategies (like Morgan Fun-\nShares, which specializes in the stocks of “habit-forming” industries\nlike booze, casinos, and cigarettes). Research by closed-end fund\nexpert Donald Cassidy of Lipper Inc. reinforces Graham’s earlier\nobservations: Diversified closed-end stock funds trading at a discount\nnot only tend to outperform those trading at a premium but are likely\nto have a better return than the average open-end mutual fund.\nSadly, however, diversified closed-end stock funds are not always\navailable at a discount in what has become a dusty, dwindling\nmarket.11\nBut there are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially\nstrong choices available in the municipal-bond area. When these\nfunds trade at a discount, their yield is amplified and they can be\nattractive, so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds\nlisted above.12\nThe new breed of exchange-traded index funds can be worth\nexploring as well. These low-cost “ETFs” sometimes offer the only\nmeans by which an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market like,\nsay, companies based in Belgium or stocks in the semiconductor\nindustry. Other index ETFs offer much broader market exposure. How-\never, they are generally not suitable for investors who wish to add\nmoney regularly, since most brokers will charge a separate commis-\nsion on every new investment you make.13\n11Unlike a mutual fund, a closed-end fund does not issue new shares\ndirectly to anyone who wants to buy them. Instead, an investor must buy\nshares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is willing\nto part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates above and below\ntheir net asset value, depending on supply and demand.\n12For more information, see www.morningstar.com and www.etfconnect.\ncom.\n13Unlike index mutual funds, index ETFs are subject to standard stock com-\nmissions when you buy and sell them—and these commissions are often\nassessed on any additional purchases or reinvested dividends.

But this advice makes no sense. From its birth in 1970\nthrough 1999, the Sequoia Fund underperformed the S & P 500\nindex in 12 out of its 29 years—or more than 41% of the time. Yet\nSequoia gained more than 12,500% over that period, versus 4,900%\nfor the index.14\nThe performance of most funds falters simply because the type of\nstocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. If you hired a manager\nto invest in a particular way, why fire him for doing what he promised?\nBy selling when a style of investing is out of fashion, you not only lock\nin a loss but lock yourself out of the all-but-inevitable recovery. One\nstudy showed that mutual-fund investors underperformed their own\nfunds by 4.7 percentage points annually from 1998 through 2001—\nsimply by buying high and selling low.15\nSo when should you sell? Here a few definite red flags:\n• a sharp and unexpected change in strategy, such as a “value”\nfund loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a “growth” fund\nbuying tons of insurance stocks in 2002;\n• an increase in expenses, suggesting that the managers are lin-\ning their own pockets;\n• large and frequent tax billsgenerated by excessive trading;\n• suddenly erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund\ngenerates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain).\n14See Sequoia’s June 30, 1999, report to shareholders at www.sequoia\nfund.com/Reports/Quarterly/SemiAnn99.htm. Sequoia has been closed to\nnew investors since 1982, which has reinforced its superb performance.\n15Jason Zweig, “What Fund Investors Really Need to Know,” Money, June,\n2002, pp. 110–115.\nwww.fx1618.comWHY WE LOVE OUR OUIJA BOARDS\nBelieving—or even just hoping—that we can pick the best funds\nof the future makes us feel better. It gives us the pleasing sensa-\ntion that we are in charge of our own investment destiny. This\n“I’m-in-control-here” feeling is part of the human condition; it’s\nwhat psychologists call overconfidence. Here are just a few\nexamples of how it works:\n• In 1999, Money Magazine asked more than 500 people\nwhether their portfolios had beaten the market. One in four\nsaid yes. When asked to specify their returns, however, 80%\nof those investors reported gains lower than the market’s.\n(Four percent had no idea how much their portfolios rose—\nbut were sure they had beaten the market anyway!)\n• A Swedish study asked drivers who had been in severe car\ncrashes to rate their own skills behind the wheel. These peo-\nple—including some the police had found responsible for the\naccidents and others who had been so badly injured that\nthey answered the survey from their hospital beds—insisted\nthey were better-than-average drivers.\n• In a poll taken in late 2000, Timeand CNN asked more than\n1,000 likely voters whether they thought they were in the top\n1% of the population by income. Nineteen percent placed\nthemselves among the richest 1% of Americans.\n• In late 1997, a survey of 750 investors found that 74%\nbelieved their mutual-fund holdings would “consistently beat\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500 each year”—even though most\nfunds fail to beat the S & P 500 in the long run and many fail\nto beat it in anyyear.1\nWhile this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psy-\nche, that doesn’t make it good investment policy. It makes sense\nto believe you can predict something only if it actually is pre-\ndictable. Unless you are realistic, your quest for self-esteem will\nend up in self-defeat.\n1See Jason Zweig, “Did You Beat the Market?” Money, January, 2000, pp.\n55–58; Time/CNN poll #15, October 25–26, 2000, question 29.\nwww.fx1618.com256 Commentary on Chapter 9\nAs the investment consultant Charles Ellis puts it, “If you’re not pre-\npared to stay married, you shouldn’t get married.”16 Fund investing is\nno different. If you’re not prepared to stick with a fund through at least\nthree lean years, you shouldn’t buy it in the first place. Patience is the\nfund investor’s single most powerful ally.\n16See interview with Ellis in Jason Zweig, “Wall Street’s Wisest Man,”\nMoney,June, 2001, pp. 49–52.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 10\nThe Investor and His Advisers\nT\nhe investment of money in securities is unique among business\noperations in that it is almost always based in some degree on\nadvice received from others. The great bulk of investors are ama-\nteurs. Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can\nprofit by professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent\nin the very concept of investment advice.\nIf the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking\nadvice they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That\nidea has some element of naïveté. Businessmen seek professional\nadvice on various elements of their business, but they do not\nexpect to be told how to make a profit. That is their own bailiwick.\nWhen they, or nonbusiness people, rely on others to make invest-\nment profitsfor them, they are expecting a kind of result for which\nthere is no true counterpart in ordinary business affairs.\nIf we assume that there are normal or standard incomeresults to\nbe obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the\nadviser can be more readily established. He will use his superior\ntraining and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and\nto make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is\nentitled. It is when the investor demands more than an average\nreturn on his money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better\nfor him, that the question arises whether more is being asked or\npromised than is likely to be delivered.\nAdvice on investments may be obtained from a variety of\nsources. These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowl-\nedgeable in securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a broker-\nage firm or investment banking house; (4) a financial service or\nwww.fx1618.com\n257258 The Intelligent Investor\nperiodical; and (5) an investment counselor.* The miscellaneous\ncharacter of this list suggests that no logical or systematic approach\nin this matter has crystallized, as yet, in the minds of investors.\nCertain common-sense considerations relate to the criterion of\nnormal or standard results mentioned above. Our basic thesis is\nthis: If the investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in han-\ndling his funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers\nstrictly to standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of\ninvestment, or he must have an unusually intimate and favorable\nknowledge of the person who is going to direct his funds into other\nchannels. But if the ordinary business or professional relationship\nexists between the investor and his advisers, he can be receptive to\nless conventional suggestions only to the extent that he himself has\ngrown in knowledge and experience and has therefore become\ncompetent to pass independent judgment on the recommendations\nof others. He has then passed from the category of defensive or\nunenterprising investor into that of aggressive or enterprising\ninvestor.\nInvestment Counsel and Trust Services of Banks\nThe truly professional investment advisers—that is, the well-\nestablished investment counsel firms, who charge substantial\nannual fees—are quite modest in their promises and pretentions.\nFor the most part they place their clients’ funds in standard inter-\nest- and dividend-paying securities, and they rely mainly on nor-\nmal investment experience for their overall results. In the typical\ncase it is doubtful whether more than 10% of the total fund is ever\ninvested in securities other than those of leading companies, plus\n*The list of sources for investment advice remains as “miscellaneous” as it\nwas when Graham wrote. A survey of investors conducted in late 2002 for\nthe Securities Industry Association, a Wall Street trade group, found that\n17% of investors depended most heavily for investment advice on a spouse\nor friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a broker; 10% on financial periodicals;\nand 24% on a financial planner. The only difference from Graham’s day is\nthat 8% of investors now rely heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial\ntelevision. (See www.sia.com.)\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 259\ngovernment bonds (including state and municipal issues); nor do\nthey make a serious effort to take advantage of swings in the gen-\neral market.\nThe leading investment-counsel firms make no claim to being\nbrilliant; they do pride themselves on being careful, conservative,\nand competent. Their primary aim is to conserve the principal\nvalue over the years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate\nof income. Any accomplishment beyond that—and they do strive\nto better the goal—they regard in the nature of extra service ren-\ndered. Perhaps their chief value to their clients lies in shielding\nthem from costly mistakes. They offer as much as the defensive\ninvestor has the right to expect from any counselor serving the\ngeneral public.\nWhat we have said about the well-established investment-\ncounsel firms applies generally to the trust and advisory services of\nthe larger banks.*\nFinancial Services\nThe so-called financial services are organizations that send out\nuniform bulletins (sometimes in the form of telegrams) to their\nsubscribers. The subjects covered may include the state and\nprospects of business, the behavior and prospect of the securities\nmarkets, and information and advice regarding individual issues.\nThere is often an “inquiry department” which will answer que-\nstons affecting an individual subscriber. The cost of the service\naverages much less than the fee that investment counselors charge\ntheir individual clients. Some organizations—notably Babson’s\nand Standard & Poor’s—operate on separate levels as a financial\nservice and as investment counsel. (Incidentally, other organiza-\n*The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has not\nchanged, but today they generally do not offer their services to investors\nwith less than $1 million in financial assets; in some cases, $5 million or\nmore is required. Today thousands of independent financial-planning firms\nperform very similar functions, although (as analyst Robert Veres puts it) the\nmutual fund has replaced blue-chip stocks as the investment of choice and\ndiversification has replaced “quality” as the standard of safety.\nwww.fx1618.com260 The Intelligent Investor\ntions—such as Scudder, Stevens & Clark—operate separately as\ninvestment counsel and as one or more investment funds.)\nThe financial services direct themselves, on the whole, to a quite\ndifferent segment of the public than do the investment-counsel\nfirms. The latters’ clients generally wish to be relieved of bother\nand the need for making decisions. The financial services offer\ninformation and guidance to those who are directing their own\nfinancial affairs or are themselves advising others. Many of these\nservices confine themselves exclusively, or nearly so, to forecasting\nmarket movements by various “technical” methods. We shall dis-\nmiss these with the observation that their work does not concern\n“investors” as the term is used in this book.\nOn the other hand, some of the best known—such as Moody’s\nInvestment Service and Standard & Poor’s—are identified with\nstatistical organizations that compile the voluminous statistical\ndata that form the basis for all serious security analysis. These ser-\nvices have a varied clientele, ranging from the most conservative-\nminded investor to the rankest speculator. As a result they must\nfind it difficult to adhere to any clear-cut or fundamental philoso-\nphy in arriving at their opinions and recommendations.\nAn old-established service of the type of Moody’s and the others\nmust obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of\ninvestors. What is it? Basically they address themselves to the mat-\nters in which the average active investor-speculator is interested,\nand their views on these either command some measure of author-\nity or at least appear more reliable than those of the unaided client.\nFor years the financial services have been making stock-market\nforecasts without anyone taking this activity very seriously. Like\neveryone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes\nwrong. Wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid\nthe risk of being proved completely wrong. (There is a well-\ndeveloped art of Delphic phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to\nwhatever the future brings.) In our view—perhaps a prejudiced\none—this segment of their work has no real significance except for\nthe light it throws on human nature in the securities markets.\nNearly everyone interested in common stocks wants to be told by\nsomeone else what he thinks the market is going to do. The\ndemand being there, it must be supplied.\nTheir interpretations and forecasts of business conditions, of\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 261\ncourse, are much more authoritative and informing. These are an\nimportant part of the great body of economic intelligence which is\nspread continuously among buyers and sellers of securities and\ntends to create fairly rational prices for stocks and bonds under\nmost circumstances. Undoubtedly the material published by the\nfinancial services adds to the store of information available and for-\ntifies the investment judgment of their clients.\nIt is difficult to evaluate their recommendations of individual\nsecurities. Each service is entitled to be judged separately, and the\nverdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive\nstudy covering many years. In our own experience we have noted\namong them a pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair\nwhat could otherwise be more useful advisory work. This is their\ngeneral view that a stock should be bought if the near-term\nprospects of the business are favorable and should be sold if these\nare unfavorable—regardless of the current price. Such a superficial\nprinciple often prevents the services from doing the sound analyti-\ncal job of which their staffs are capable—namely, to ascertain\nwhether a given stock appears over- or undervalued at the current\nprice in the light of its indicated long-term future earning power.\nThe intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on\nthe basis of recommendations received from a financial service. Once\nthis point is established, the role of the financial service then becomes\nthe useful one of supplying information and offering suggestions.\nAdvice from Brokerage Houses\nProbably the largest volume of information and advice to the\nsecurity-owning public comes from stockbrokers. These are mem-\nbers of the New York Stock Exchange, and of other exchanges,\nwho execute buying and selling orders for a standard commission.\nPractically all the houses that deal with the public maintain a\n“statistical” or analytical department, which answers inquiries\nand makes recommendations. Agreat deal of analytical literature,\nsome of it elaborate and expensive, is distributed gratis to the\nfirms’ customers—more impressively referred to as clients.\nA great deal is at stake in the innocent-appearing question\nwhether “customers” or “clients” is the more appropriate name. A\nbusiness has customers; a professional person or organization has\nwww.fx1618.com262 The Intelligent Investor\nclients. The Wall Street brokerage fraternity has probably the high-\nest ethical standards of any business, but it is still feeling its way\ntoward the standards and standing of a true profession.*\nIn the past Wall Street has thrived mainly on speculation, and\nstock-market speculators as a class were almost certain to lose\nmoney. Hence it has been logically impossible for brokerage\nhouses to operate on a thoroughly professional basis. To do that\nwould have required them to direct their efforts toward reducing\nrather than increasing their business.\nThe farthest that certain brokerage houses have gone in that\ndirection—and could have been expected to go—is to refrain from\ninducing or encouraging anyone to speculate. Such houses have\nconfined themselves to executing orders given them, to supplying\nfinancial information and analyses, and to rendering opinions on\nthe investment merits of securities. Thus, in theory at least, they are\ndevoid of all responsibility for either the profits or the losses of\ntheir speculative customers.†\nMost stock-exchange houses, however, still adhere to the old-\ntime slogans that they are in business to make commissions and\nthat the way to succeed in business is to give the customers what\nthey want. Since the most profitable customers want speculative\nadvice and suggestions, the thinking and activities of the typical\nfirm are pretty closely geared to day-to-day trading in the market.\nThus it tries hard to help its customers make money in a field\nwhere they are condemned almost by mathematical law to lose in\nthe end.‡ By this we mean that the speculative part of their opera-\ntions cannot be profitable over the long run for most brokerage-\n*Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall Street has\never seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly cynical enough. Wall\nStreet may have higher ethical standards than some businesses (smug-\ngling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and journalism come to mind)\nbut the investment world nevertheless has enough liars, cheaters, and\nthieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks frantically busy for decades to come.\n†The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the belief\nthat Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable advice have\nlearned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this point.\n‡Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham was directing\nat full-serwvicwe bwro.kfexrs1, 6en1de8d. ucpo ampplying to discount Internet brokers in theThe Investor and His Advisers 263\nhouse customers. But to the extent that their operations resemble\ntrue investing they may produce investment gains that more than\noffset the speculative losses.\nThe investor obtains advice and information from stock-\nexchange houses through two types of employees, now known\nofficially as “customers’ brokers” (or “account executives”) and\nfinancial analysts.\nThe customer’s broker, also called a “registered representative,”\nformerly bore the less dignified title of “customer’s man.” Today\nhe is for the most part an individual of good character and consid-\nerable knowledge of securities, who operates under a rigid code of\nright conduct. Nevertheless, since his business is to earn commis-\nsions, he can hardly avoid being speculation-minded. Thus the\nsecurity buyer who wants to avoid being influenced by speculative\nconsiderations will ordinarily have to be careful and explicit in his\ndealing with his customer’s broker; he will have to show clearly, by\nword and deed, that he is not interested in anything faintly resem-\nbling a stock-market “tip.” Once the customer’s broker under-\nstands clearly that he has a real investor on his hands, he will\nrespect this point of view and cooperate with it.\nThe financial analyst, formerly known chiefly as security ana-\nlyst, is a person of particular concern to the author, who has been\none himself for more than five decades and has helped educate\ncountless others. At this stage we refer only to the financial ana-\nlysts employed by brokerage houses. The function of the security\nanalyst is clear enough from his title. It is he who works up the\ndetailed studies of individual securities, develops careful compar-\nisons of various issues in the same field, and forms an expert opin-\nion of the safety or attractiveness or intrinsic value of all the\ndifferent kinds of stocks and bonds.\nlate 1990s. These firms spent millions of dollars on flashy advertising that\ngoaded their customers into trading more and trading faster. Most of those\ncustomers ended up picking their own pockets, instead of paying someone\nelse to do it for them—and the cheap commissions on that kind of transac-\ntion are a poor consolation for the result. More traditional brokerage firms,\nmeanwhile, began emphasizing financial planning and “integrated asset\nmanagement,” instead of compensating their brokers only on the basis of\nhow wmawny wco.mfxm1iss6io1ns8 t.hceyo cmould generate.264 The Intelligent Investor\nBy what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal\nrequirements for being a security analyst. Contrast with this the\nfacts that a customer’s broker must pass an examination, meet the\nrequired character tests, and be duly accepted and registered by\nthe New York Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, nearly all the\nyounger analysts have had extensive business-school training, and\nthe oldsters have acquired at least the equivalent in the school of\nlong experience. In the great majority of cases, the employing bro-\nkerage house can be counted on to assure itself of the qualifications\nand competence of its analysts.*\nThe customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security\nanalysts directly, or his contact may be an indirect one via the cus-\ntomer’s broker. In either case the analyst is available to the client\nfor a considerable amount of information and advice. Let us make\nan emphatic statement here. The value of the security analyst to the\ninvestor depends largely on the investor’s own attitude. If the\ninvestor asks the analyst the right questions, he is likely to get\nthe right—or at least valuable—answers. The analysts hired by\nbrokerage houses, we are convinced, are greatly handicapped by\nthe general feeling that they are supposed to be market analysts as\nwell. When they are asked whether a given common stock is\n“sound,” the question often means, “Is this stock likely to advance\nduring the next few months?” As a result many of them are com-\n*This remains true, although many of Wall Street’s best analysts hold the\ntitle of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is awarded by the\nAssociation of Investment Management & Research (formerly the Financial\nAnalysts Federation) only after the candidate has completed years of rigor-\nous study and passed a series of difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts\nworldwide have been certified as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor\nStanley Block found that most CFAs ignore Graham’s teachings: Growth\npotential ranks higher than quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in\ndetermining P/E ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on\nrecent price than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley\nBlock, “A Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Ana-\nlysts Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org. As Graham was\nfond of saying, his own books have been read by—and ignored by—more\npeople than any other books in finance.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 265\npelled to analyze with one eye on the stock ticker—a pose not con-\nducive to sound thinking or worthwhile conclusions.*\nIn the next section of this book we shall deal with some of the con-\ncepts and possible achievements of security analysis. Agreat many\nanalysts working for stock exchange firms could be of prime assis-\ntance to the bona fide investor who wants to be sure that he gets full\nvalue for his money, and possibly a little more. As in the case of the\ncustomers’ brokers, what is needed at the beginning is a clear under-\nstanding by the analyst of the investor’s attitude and objectives. Once\nthe analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is value-\nminded rather than quotation-minded, there is an excellent chance\nthat his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit.\nThe CFACertificate for Financial Analysts\nAn important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional\nstanding and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of\nchartered financial analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior\npractitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests\nof fitness.1The subjects covered include security analysis and port-\nfolio management. The analogy with the long-established profes-\nsional title of certified public accountant (CPA) is evident and\nintentional. This relatively new apparatus of recognition and con-\ntrol should serve to elevate the standards of financial analysts and\neventually to place their work on a truly professional basis.†\n*It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere commoners to\ncontact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility of institutional investors\nare permitted to approach the throne of the almighty Wall Street analyst. An indi-\nvidual investor might, perhaps, have some luck calling analysts who work at\n“regional” brokerage firms headquartered outside of New York City. The investor\nrelations area at the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a\nlist of analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and\nwww.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the intelligent\ninvestor should remember that most analysts do not analyze businesses.\nInstead, they engage in guesswork about future stock prices.\n†Benjamin Graham was the prime force behind the establishment of the CFA\nprogram, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became a reality.\nwww.fx1618.com266 The Intelligent Investor\nDealings with Brokerage Houses\nOne of the most disquieting developments of the period in\nwhich we write this revision has been the financial embarrass-\nment—in plain words, bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy—of quite a\nfew New York Stock Exchange firms, including at least two of con-\nsiderable size.* This is the first time in half a century or more that\nsuch a thing has happened, and it is startling for more than one\nreason. For many decades the New York Stock Exchange has been\nmoving in the direction of closer and stricter controls over the\noperations and financial condition of its members—including min-\nimum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the like. Besides\nthis, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges and their\nmembers by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally,\nthe stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable\nconditions—namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum\ncommission rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a lim-\nited number of member firms.\nThe first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969)\nwere attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was\nclaimed, overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and\nproduced many troubles in making financial settlements. It should\nbe pointed out this was probably the first time in history that\nimportant enterprises have gone broke because they had more\nbusiness than they could handle. In 1970, as brokerage failures\nincreased, they were blamed chiefly on “the falling off in volume.”\nA strange complaint when one reflects that the turnover of the\n*The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore, Forgan\n& Co. and Goodbody & Co. Du Pont (founded by the heirs to the chemical\nfortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970 only after Texas entrepreneur\nH. Ross Perot lent more than $50 million to the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-\nlargest brokerage firm in the United States, would have failed in late 1970\nhad Merrill Lynch not acquired it. Hayden, Stone & Co. would also have\ngone under if it had not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven bro-\nkerage firms went bust. The farcical story of Wall Street’s frenzied over-\nexpansion in the late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go\nYears(John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999).\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 267\nNYSE in 1970 totaled 2,937 million shares, the largestvolume in its\nhistory and well over twice as large as in any year before 1965.\nDuring the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual\nvolume had averaged “only” 712 million shares—one quarter of\nthe 1970 figure—but the brokerage business had enjoyed the great-\nest prosperity in its history. If, as it appears, the member firms as a\nwhole had allowed their overhead and other expenses to increase\nat a rate that could not sustain even a mild reduction in volume\nduring part of a year, this does not speak well for either their busi-\nness acumen or their financial conservatism.\nAthird explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out\nof a mist of concealment, and we suspect that it is the most plausi-\nble and significant of the three. It seems that a good part of the cap-\nital of certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common\nstocks owned by the individual partners. Some of these seem to\nhave been highly speculative and carried at inflated values. When\nthe market declined in 1969 the quotations of such securities fell\ndrastically and a substantial part of the capital of the firms van-\nished with them.2 In effect the partners were speculating with the\ncapital that was supposed to protect the customers against the\nordinary financial hazards of the brokerage business, in order to\nmake a double profit thereon. This was inexcusable; we refrain\nfrom saying more.\nThe investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating\nhis financial policies but also in the associated details. These\ninclude the choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders. Up to\nnow it was sufficient to counsel our readers to deal only with a\nmember of the New York Stock Exchange, unless he had com-\npelling reasons to use a nonmember firm. Reluctantly, we must\nadd some further advice in this area. We think that people who do\nnot carry margin accounts—and in our vocabulary this means all\nnonprofessional investors—should have the delivery and receipt of\ntheir securities handled by their bank. When giving a buying order\nto your brokers you can instruct them to deliver the securities\nbought to your bank against payment therefor by the bank; con-\nversely, when selling you can instruct your bank to deliver the\nsecurities to the broker against payment of the proceeds. These ser-\nvices will cost a little extra but they should be well worth the\nexpense in terms of safety and peace of mind. This advice may be\nwww.fx1618.com268 The Intelligent Investor\ndisregarded, as no longer called for, after the investor is sure that\nall the problems of stock-exchange firms have been disposed of,\nbut not before.*\nInvestment Bankers\nThe term “investment banker” is applied to a firm that engages\nto an important extent in originating, underwriting, and selling\nnew issues of stocks and bonds. (To underwrite means to guaran-\ntee to the issuing corporation, or other issuer, that the security will\nbe fully sold.) Anumber of the brokerage houses carry on a certain\namount of underwriting activity. Generally this is confined to par-\nticipating in underwriting groups formed by leading investment\nbankers. There is an additional tendency for brokerage firms to\noriginate and sponsor a minor amount of new-issue financing, par-\nticularly in the form of smaller issues of common stocks when a\nbull market is in full swing.\nInvestment banking is perhaps the most respectable department\nof the Wall Street community, because it is here that finance plays\nits constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of\nindustry. In fact, much of the theoretical justification for maintain-\ning active stock markets, notwithstanding their frequent specula-\ntive excesses, lies in the fact that organized security exchanges\nfacilitate the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks. If investors or\nspeculators could not expect to see a ready market for a new secu-\nrity offered them, they might well refuse to buy it.\nThe relationship between the investment banker and the\n*Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted electronically, and\nsecurities are no longer physically “delivered.” Thanks to the establishment\nof the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970,\ninvestors are generally assured of recovering their full account values if their\nbrokerage firm becomes insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consor-\ntium of brokers; all the members agree to pool their assets to cover losses\nincurred by the customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s pro-\ntection eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery\nthrough a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 269\ninvestor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer.\nFor many years past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar\nvalue has consisted of bond issues that were purchased in the main\nby financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. In\nthis business the security salesmen have been dealing with shrewd\nand experienced buyers. Hence any recommendations made by the\ninvestment bankers to these customers have had to pass careful\nand skeptical scrutiny. Thus these transactions are almost always\neffected on a businesslike footing.\nBut a different situation obtains in a relationship between the\nindividualsecurity buyer and the investment banking firms, includ-\ning the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is\nfrequently inexperienced and seldom shrewd. He is easily influ-\nenced by what the salesman tells him, especially in the case of\ncommon-stock issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying\nis chiefly to make a quick profit. The effect of all this is that the\npublic investor’s protection lies less in his own critical faculty than\nin the scruples and ethics of the offering houses.3\nIt is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting\nfirms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles\nof adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust\nhimself to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this\npoint: “The bad results of this unsound attitude show themselves\nrecurrently in the underwriting field and with notable effects in the\nsale of new common stock issues during periods of active specula-\ntion.” Shortly thereafter this warning proved urgently needed. As\nalready pointed out, the years 1960–61 and, again, 1968–69 were\nmarked by an unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest qual-\nity, sold to the public at absurdly high offering prices and in many\ncases pushed much higher by heedless speculation and some semi-\nmanipulation. Anumber of the more important Wall Street houses\nhave participated to some degree in these less than creditable activ-\nities, which demonstrates that the familiar combination of greed,\nfolly, and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the financial\nscene.\nThe intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and rec-\nommendations received from investment banking houses, espe-\ncially those known by him to have an excellent reputation; but he\nwill be sure to bring sound and independent judgment to bear\nwww.fx1618.com270 The Intelligent Investor\nupon these suggestions—either his own, if he is competent, or that\nof some other type of adviser.*\nOther Advisers\nIt is a good old custom, especially in the smaller towns, to con-\nsult one’s local banker about investments. A commercial banker\nmay not be a thoroughgoing expert on security values, but he is\nexperienced and conservative. He is especially useful to the\nunskilled investor, who is often tempted to stray from the straight\nand unexciting path of a defensive policy and needs the steadying\ninfluence of a prudent mind. The more alert and aggressive\ninvestor, seeking counsel in the selection of security bargains, will\nnot ordinarily find the commercial banker’s viewpoint to be espe-\ncially suited to his own objectives.†\nWe take a more critical attitude toward the widespread custom\nof asking investment advice from relatives or friends. The inquirer\nalways thinks he has good reason for assuming that the person\nconsulted has superior knowledge or experience. Our own obser-\nvation indicates that it is almost as difficult to select satisfactory lay\nadvisers as it is to select the proper securities unaided. Much bad\nadvice is given free.\nSummary\nInvestors who are prepared to pay a fee for the management of\ntheir funds may wisely select some well-established and well-\nrecommended investment-counsel firm. Alternatively, they may\nuse the investment department of a large trust company or the\nsupervisory service supplied on a fee basis by a few of the leading\nNew York Stock Exchange houses. The results to be expected are in\nno wise exceptional, but they are commensurate with those of the\naverage well-informed and cautious investor.\n*Those who heeded Graham’s advice would not have been suckered into\nbuying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.\n†This traditional role of bankers has for the most part been supplanted by\naccountants, lawyers, or financial planners.\nwww.fx1618.comThe Investor and His Advisers 271\nMost security buyers obtain advice without paying for it specifi-\ncally. It stands to reason, therefore, that in the majority of cases they\nare not entitled to and should not expect better than average results.\nThey should be wary of all persons, whether customers’ brokers or\nsecurity salesmen, who promise spectacular income or profits. This\napplies both to the selection of securities and to guidance in the elu-\nsive (and perhaps illusive) art of trading in the market.\nDefensive investors, as we have defined them, will not ordi-\nnarily be equipped to pass independent judgment on the security\nrecommendations made by their advisers. But they can be\nexplicit—and even repetitiously so—in stating the kind of securi-\nties they want to buy. If they follow our prescription they will con-\nfine themselves to high-grade bonds and the common stocks of\nleading corporations, preferably those that can be purchased at\nindividual price levels that are not high in the light of experience\nand analysis. The security analyst of any reputable stock-exchange\nhouse can make up a suitable list of such common stocks and can\ncertify to the investor whether or not the existing price level there-\nfor is a reasonably conservative one as judged by past experience.\nThe aggressive investor will ordinarily work in active coopera-\ntion with his advisers. He will want their recommendations\nexplained in detail, and he will insist on passing his own judgment\nupon them. This means that the investor will gear his expectations\nand the character of his security operations to the development of\nhis own knowledge and experience in the field. Only in the excep-\ntional case, where the integrity and competence of the advisers\nhave been thoroughly demonstrated, should the investor act upon\nthe advice of others without understanding and approving the\ndecision made.\nThere have always been unprincipled stock salesmen and fly-\nby-night stock brokers, and—as a matter of course—we have\nadvised our readers to confine their dealings, if possible, to mem-\nbers of the New York Stock Exchange. But we are reluctantly com-\npelled to add the extra-cautious counsel that security deliveries\nand payments be made through the intermediary of the investor’s\nbank.

Unfortu-\nnately, many do-it-yourselfers asserted their independence right before\nthe worst bear market since the Great Depression—making them feel,\nin the end, that they were fools for going it alone.

All in all, just as there’s no\nreason you can’t manage your own portfolio, so there’s no shame in\nseeking professional help in managing it.1\nHow can you tell if you need a hand? Here are some signals:\nBig losses. If your portfolio lost more than 40% of its value from\nthe beginning of 2000 through the end of 2002, then you did even\nworse than the dismal performance of the stock market itself. It hardly\nmatters whether you blew it by being lazy, reckless, or just unlucky;\nafter such a giant loss, your portfolio is crying out for help.\nBusted budgets. If you perennially struggle to make ends meet,\nhave no idea where your money goes, find it impossible to save on a\nregular schedule, and chronically fail to pay your bills on time, then\nyour finances are out of control. An adviser can help you get a grip on\nyour money by designing a comprehensive financial plan that will out-\nline how—and how much—you should spend, borrow, save, and invest.\nChaotic portfolios.All too many investors thought they were diver-\nsified in the late 1990s because they owned 39 “different” Internet\nstocks, or seven “different” U.S. growth-stock funds. But that’s like\nthinking that an all-soprano chorus can handle singing “Old Man\nRiver” better than a soprano soloist can. No matter how many sopra-\nnos you add, that chorus will never be able to nail all those low notes\nuntil some baritones join the group. Likewise, if all your holdings go up\nand down together, you lack the investing harmony that true diversifi-\ncation brings. A professional “asset-allocation” plan can help.\nMajor changes. If you’ve become self-employed and need to set\nup a retirement plan, your aging parents don’t have their finances in\norder, or college for your kids looks unaffordable, an adviser can not\nonly provide peace of mind but help you make genuine improvements\nin the quality of your life. What’s more, a qualified professional can\nensure that you benefit from and comply with the staggering complex-\nity of the tax laws and retirement rules.\nTRUST, THEN VERIFY\nRemember that financial con artists thrive by talking you into trusting\nthem and by talking you out of investigating them.

As Ronald Reagan used to say, “Trust, then ver-\nify.” Start off by thinking of the handful of people you know best and\ntrust the most. Then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom they\ntrust and who, they feel, delivers good value for his fees.

If the adviser is a\nstockbroker or insurance agent, contact the office of your state’s\nsecurities commissioner (a convenient directory of online links is at\nwww.nasaa.org) to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer\ncomplaints have been filed against the adviser.3 If you’re considering\nan accountant who also functions as a financial adviser, your state’s\naccounting regulators (whom you can find through the National Asso-\nciation of State Boards of Accountancy at www.nasba.org) will tell\nyou whether his or her record is clean.\nFinancial planners (or their firms) must register with either the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission or securities regulators in the\nstate where their practice is based.

Melanie Senter Lubin, securities commissioner for the\nState of Maryland, suggests being on guard for words and\nphrases that can spell trouble. If your adviser keeps saying\nthem—or twisting your arm to do anything that makes you\nuncomfortable—“then get in touch with the authorities very\nquickly,” warns Lubin. Here’s the kind of lingo that should set off\nwarning bells:\n“offshore” “exclusive”\n“the opportunity of a “You should focus on\nlifetime” performance, not\n“prime bank” fees.”\n“This baby’s gonna “Don’t you want to be\nmove.” rich?”\n“guaranteed” “can’t lose”\n“You need to hurry.” “The upside is huge.”\n“It’s a sure thing.” “There’s no downside.”\n“our proprietary “I’m putting my mother\ncomputer model” in it.”\n“The smart money is “Trust me.”\nbuying it.” “commodities trading”\n“options strategy” “monthly returns”\n“It’s a no-brainer.” “active asset-allocation\n“You can’t afford not to strategy”\nown it.” “We can cap your\n“We can beat the downside.”\nmarket.” “No one else knows how\n“You’ll be sorry if you to do this.”\ndon’t...”\nwww.fx1618.com276 Commentary on Chapter 10\nGETTING TO KNOW YOU\nA leading financial-planning newsletter recently canvassed dozens of\nadvisers to get their thoughts on how you should go about interview-\ning them.4In screening an adviser, your goals should be to:\n• determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just\ngoes through the motions\n• establish whether he or she understands the fundamental princi-\nples of investing as they are outlined in this book\n• assess whether he or she is sufficiently educated, trained, and\nexperienced to help you.\nHere are some of the questions that prominent financial planners\nrecommended any prospective client should ask:\nWhy are you in this business? What is the mission statement of your\nfirm? Besides your alarm clock, what makes you get up in the morning?\nWhat is your investing philosophy? Do you use stocks or mutual\nfunds? Do you use technical analysis? Do you use market timing? (A\n“yes” to either of the last two questions is a “no” signal to you.)\nDo you focus solely on asset management, or do you also advise\non taxes, estate and retirement planning, budgeting and debt manage-\nment, and insurance? How do your education, experience, and cre-\ndentials qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice?5\nWhat needs do your clients typically have in common? How can\nyou help me achieve my goals? How will you track and report my\nprogress? Do you provide a checklist that I can use to monitor the\nimplementation of any financial plan we develop?\n4Robert Veres, editor and publisher of the Inside Information newsletter,\ngenerously shared these responses for this book. Other checklists of ques-\ntions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and www.napfa.org.\n5Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has taken\nand passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other “alphabet soup”\nof credentials brandished by financial planners, including the “CFM” or the\n“CMFC,” signify very little.) More important, by contacting the organization\nthat awards the credential, you can verify his record and check that he has\nnot been disciplined for violations of rules or ethics.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 10 277\nHow do you choose investments? What investing approach do you\nbelieve is most successful, and what evidence can you show me that\nyou have achieved that kind of success for your clients? What do you\ndo when an investment performs poorly for an entire year? (Any\nadviser who answers “sell” is not worth hiring.)\nDo you, when recommending investments, accept any form of com-\npensation from any third party? Why or why not? Under which circum-\nstances? How much, in actual dollars, do you estimate I would pay for\nyour services the first year? What would make that number go up or\ndown over time? (If fees will consume more than 1% of your assets\nannually, you should probably shop for another adviser.6)\nHow many clients do you have, and how often do you communicate\nwith them?

What\ndetermines whether a client speaks to you or to your support staff?\nHow long do clients typically stay with you?\nCan I see a sample account statement? (If you can’t understand it,\nask the adviser to explain it. If you can’t understand his explanation,\nhe’s not right for you.)\nDo you consider yourself financially successful? Why? How do you\ndefine financial success?\nHow high an average annual return do you think is feasible on my\ninvestments? (Anything over 8% to10% is unrealistic.)\nWill you provide me with your résumé, your Form ADV, and at least\nthree references? (If the adviser or his firm is required to file an ADV,\nand he will not provide you a copy, get up and leave—and keep one\nhand on your wallet as you go.)\nHave you ever had a formal complaint filed against you? Why did\nthe last client who fired you do so?\n6If you have less than $100,000 to invest, you may not be able to find a\nfinancial adviser who will take your account. In that case, buy a diversified\nbasket of low-cost index funds, follow the behavioral advice throughout this\nbook, and your portfolio should eventually grow to the level at which you can\nafford an adviser.\nwww.fx1618.com278 Commentary on Chapter 10\nDEFEATING YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY\nFinally, bear in mind that great financial advisers do not grow on trees.\nOften, the best already have as many clients as they can handle—and\nmay be willing to take you on only if you seem like a good match. So\nthey will ask you some tough questions as well, which might include:\nWhy do you feel you need a financial adviser?\nWhat are your long-term goals?\nWhat has been your greatest frustration in dealing with other advis-\ners (including yourself)?\nDo you have a budget? Do you live within your means? What per-\ncentage of your assets do you spend each year?\nWhen we look back a year from now, what will I need to have\naccomplished in order for you to be happy with your progress?\nHow do you handle conflicts or disagreements?\nHow did you respond emotionally to the bear market that began in\n2000?\nWhat are your worst financial fears? Your greatest financial hopes?\nWhat rate of return on your investments do you consider reason-\nable? (Base your answer on Chapter 3.)\nAn adviser who doesn’t ask questions like these—and who does\nnot show enough interest in you to sense intuitively what other ques-\ntions you consider to be the right ones—is not a good fit.\nAbove all else, you should trust your adviser enough to permit him\nor her to protect you from your worst enemy—yourself. “You hire an\nadviser,” explains commentator Nick Murray, “not to manage money\nbut to manage you.”\n“If the adviser is a line of defense between you and your worst\nimpulsive tendencies,” says financial-planning analyst Robert Veres,\n“then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of\nyou control them.” Among those systems:\n• a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn,\nsave, spend, borrow, and invest your money;\n• aninvestment policy statementthat spells out your fundamental\napproach to investing;\n• an asset-allocation plan that details how much money you will\nkeep in different investment categories.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 10 279\nThese are the building blocks on which good financial decisions\nmust be founded, and they should be created mutually—by you and\nthe adviser—rather than imposed unilaterally. You should not invest a\ndollar or make a decision until you are satisfied that these foundations\nare in place and in accordance with your wishes.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 11\nSecurity Analysis for the Lay Investor:\nGeneral Approach\nF\ninancial analysis is now a well-established and flourishing pro-\nfession, or semiprofession. The various societies of analysts that\nmake up the National Federation of Financial Analysts have over\n13,000 members, most of whom make their living out of this\nbranch of mental activity. Financial analysts have textbooks, a code\nof ethics, and a quarterly journal.* They also have their share of\nunresolved problems. In recent years there has been a tendency to\nreplace the general concept of “security analysis” by that of “finan-\ncial analysis.” The latter phrase has a broader implication and is\nbetter suited to describe the work of most senior analysts on Wall\nStreet. It would be useful to think of security analysis as limiting\nitself pretty much to the examination and evaluation of stocks and\nbonds, whereas financial analysis would comprise that work, plus\nthe determination of investment policy (portfolio selection), plus a\nsubstantial amount of general economic analysis.1 In this chapter\nwe shall use whatever designation is most applicable, with chief\nemphasis on the work of the security analyst proper.\nThe security analyst deals with the past, the present, and the\nfuture of any given security issue. He describes the business; he\nsummarizes its operating results and financial position; he sets\nforth its strong and weak points, its possibilities and risks; he esti-\nmates its future earning power under various assumptions, or as a\n*The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the Association for\nInvestment Management and Research; its “quarterly” research publication,\ntheFinancial Analysts Journal,now appears every other month.\nwww.fx1618.com\n280Security Analysis for theLay Investor 281\n“best guess.” He makes elaborate comparisons of various compa-\nnies, or of the same company at various times. Finally, he expresses\nan opinion as to the safety of the issue, if it is a bond or investment-\ngrade preferred stock, or as to its attractiveness as a purchase, if it\nis a common stock.\nIn doing all these things the security analyst avails himself of a\nnumber of techniques, ranging from the elementary to the most\nabstruse. He may modify substantially the figures in the\ncompany’s annual statements, even though they bear the sacred\nimprimaturof the certified public accountant. He is on the lookout\nparticularly for items in these reports that may mean a good deal\nmore or less than they say.\nThe security analyst develops and applies standards of safety by\nwhich we can conclude whether a given bond or preferred stock\nmay be termed sound enough to justify purchase for investment.\nThese standards relate primarily to past average earnings, but they\nare concerned also with capital structure, working capital, asset\nvalues, and other matters.\nIn dealing with common stocks the security analyst until\nrecently has only rarely applied standards of value as well defined\nas were his standards of safety for bonds and preferred stocks.\nMost of the time he contended himself with a summary of past per-\nformances, a more or less general forecast of the future—with par-\nticular emphasis on the next 12 months—and a rather arbitrary\nconclusion. The latter was, and still is, often drawn with one eye on\nthe stock ticker or the market charts. In the past few years, how-\never, much attention has been given by practicing analysts to the\nproblem of valuing growth stocks. Many of these have sold at such\nhigh prices in relation to past and current earnings that those rec-\nommending them have felt a special obligation to justify their pur-\nchase by fairly definite projections of expected earnings running\nfairly far into the future. Certain mathematical techniques of a\nrather sophisticated sort have perforce been invoked to support the\nvaluations arrived at.\nWeshall deal with these techniques, in foreshortened form, a lit-\ntle later. However, we must point out a troublesome paradox here,\nwhich is that the mathematical valuations have become most\nprevalent precisely in those areas where one might consider them\nleast reliable. For the more dependent the valuation becomes on\nwww.fx1618.com282 The Intelligent Investor\nanticipations of the future—and the less it is tied to a figure\ndemonstrated by past performance—the more vulnerable it\nbecomes to possible miscalculation and serious error. Alarge part\nof the value found for a high-multiplier growth stock is derived\nfrom future projections which differ markedly from past perfor-\nmance—except perhaps in the growth rate itself. Thus it may be\nsaid that security analysts today find themselves compelled to\nbecome most mathematical and “scientific” in the very situations\nwhich lend themselves least auspiciously to exact treatment.*\nLet us proceed, nonetheless, with our discussion of the more\nimportant elements and techniques of security analysis. The pres-\nent highly condensed treatment is directed to the needs of the non-\nprofessional investor. At the minimum he should understand what\nthe security analyst is talking about and driving at; beyond that, he\nshould be equipped, if possible, to distinguish between superficial\nand sound analysis.\nSecurity analysis for the lay investor is thought of as beginning\n*The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future period\nover which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast becomes to the\nslightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a company earning $1 per\nshare can raise that profit by 15% a year for the next 15 years, its earnings\nwould end up at $8.14. If the market values the company at 35 times earn-\nings, the stock would finish the period at roughly $285. But if earnings grow\nat 14% instead of 15%, the company would earn $7.14 at the end of the\nperiod—and, in the shock of that shortfall, investors would no longer be will-\ning to pay 35 times earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would\nend up around $140 per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced\nmathematics gives the appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process\nof foreseeing the future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who\nclaims to hold any complex computational key to basic financial problems.\nAs Graham put it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have\nnever seen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\nrelated investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most\nelementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra, you\ncould take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to substitute\ntheory for experience, and usually also to give to speculation the deceptive\nguise of investment.” (See p. 570.)\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 283\nwith the interpretation of a company’s annual financial report. This\nis a subject which we have covered for laymen in a separate book,\nentitled The Interpretation of Financial Statements.2 We do not con-\nsider it necessary or appropriate to traverse the same ground in\nthis chapter, especially since the emphasis in the present book is on\nprinciples and attitudes rather than on information and descrip-\ntion. Let us pass on to two basic questions underlying the selection\nof investments. What are the primary tests of safety of a corporate\nbond or preferred stock? What are the chief factors entering into\nthe valuation of a common stock?\nBond Analysis\nThe most dependable and hence the most respectable branch of\nsecurity analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of bond\nissues and investment-grade preferred stocks. The chief criterion\nused for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest\ncharges have been covered by available earnings for some years in\nthe past. In the case of preferred stocks, it is the number of times\nthat bond interest and preferred dividends combined have been\ncovered.\nThe exact standards applied will vary with different authorities.\nSince the tests are at bottom arbitrary, there is no way to determine\nprecisely the most suitable criteria. In the 1961 revision of our text-\nbook, Security Analysis, we recommend certain “coverage” stan-\ndards, which appear in Table 11-1.*\nOur basic test is applied only to the average results for a period\nof years. Other authorities require also that a minimumcoverage be\nshown for every year considered. We approve a “poorest-year” test\n*In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to assemble\nhis or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds invest in corporate\nbonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified bundle of securities. Since it is\nnot feasible to build a diversified bond portfolio on your own unless you\nhave at least $100,000, the typical intelligent investor will be best off simply\nbuying a low-cost bond fund and leaving the painstaking labor of credit\nresearch to its managers. For more on bond funds, see the commentary on\nChapter 4.\nwww.fx1618.com284 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 11-1 Recommended Minimum “Coverage” for Bonds\nand Preferred Stocks\nA.

Obviously it would be much harder for an\nindustrial company to show a seven-times coverage of interest\ncharges at 8% than at 41⁄%. To meet this changed situation we now\n2\nsuggestw anw awlte.rfnxa1tiv6e1 re8q.uciroemment related to the percent earned onSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 285\ntheprincipalamount of the debt. These figures might be 33% before\ntaxes for an industrial company, 20% for a public utility, and 25%\nfor a railroad. It should be borne in mind here that the rate actually\npaid by most companies on their total debt is considerably less\nthan the current 8% figures, since they have the benefit of older\nissues bearing lower coupons. The “poorest year” requirement\ncould be set at about two-thirds of the seven-year requirement.\nIn addition to the earnings-coverage test, a number of others are\ngenerally applied. These include the following:\n1. Size of Enterprise. There is a minimum standard in terms of\nvolume of business for a corporation—varying as between indus-\ntrials, utilities, and railroads—and of population for a municipality.\n2. Stock/Equity Ratio. This is the ratio of the market price of the\njunior stock issues* to the total face amount of the debt, or the debt\nplus preferred stock. It is a rough measure of the protection, or “cush-\nion,” afforded by the presence of a junior investment that must first\nbear the brunt of unfavorable developments. This factor includes the\nmarket’s appraisal of the future prospects of the enterprise.\n3.Property Value.The asset values, as shown on the balance sheet\nor as appraised, were formerly considered the chief security and\nprotection for a bond issue. Experience has shown that in most\ncases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the\nassets lose most of their reputed value. Asset values, however,\nretain importance as a separate test of ample security for bonds\nand preferred stocks in three enterprise groups: public utilities\n(because rates may depend largely on the property investment),\nreal-estate concerns, and investment companies.\nAt this point the alert investor should ask, “How dependable are\ntests of safety that are measured by past and present performance,\nin view of the fact that payment of interest and principal depends\nupon what the future will bring forth?” The answer can be founded\n*By “junior stock issues” Graham means shares of common stock. Pre-\nferred stock is considered “senior” to common stock because the company\nmust pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any dividends on the\ncommwonw. w.fx1618.com286 The Intelligent Investor\nonly on experience. Investment history shows that bonds and pre-\nferred stocks that have met stringent tests of safety, based on the\npast, have in the great majority of cases been able to face the vicissi-\ntudes of the future successfully. This has been strikingly demon-\nstrated in the major field of railroad bonds—a field that has been\nmarked by a calamitous frequency of bankruptcies and serious\nlosses. In nearly every case the roads that got into trouble had long\nbeen overbonded, had shown an inadequate coverage of fixed\ncharges in periods of average prosperity, and would thus have been\nruled out by investors who applied strict tests of safety. Conversely,\npractically every road that has met such tests has escaped financial\nembarrassment. Our premise was strikingly vindicated by the\nfinancial history of the numerous railroads reorganized in the 1940s\nand in 1950. All of these, with one exception, started their careers\nwith fixed charges reduced to a point where the current coverage of\nfixed-interest requirements was ample, or at least respectable. The\nexception was the New Haven Railroad, which in its reorganization\nyear, 1947, earned its new charges only about 1.1 times. In conse-\nquence, while all the other roads were able to come through rather\ndifficult times with solvency unimpaired, the New Haven relapsed\ninto trusteeship (for the third time) in 1961.\nIn Chapter 17 below we shall consider some aspects of the bank-\nruptcy of the Penn Central Railroad, which shook the financial\ncommunity in 1970. An elementary fact in this case was that the\ncoverage of fixed charges did not meet conservative standards as\nearly as 1965; hence a prudent bond investor would have avoided\nor disposed of the bond issues of the system long before its finan-\ncial collapse.\nOur observations on the adequacy of the past record to judge\nfuture safety apply, and to an even greater degree, to the public\nutilities, which constitute a major area for bond investment.\nReceivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or\nsystem is almost impossible. Since Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission control was instituted,* along with the breakup of most of\n*After investors lost billions of dollars on the shares of recklessly assem-\nbled utility companies in 1929–1932, Congress authorized the SEC to reg-\nulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public Utility Holding Company\nAct of 19w35w. w.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 287\nthe holding-company systems, public-utility financing has been\nsound and bankruptcies unknown. The financial troubles of elec-\ntric and gas utilities in the 1930s were traceable almost 100% to\nfinancial excesses and mismanagement, which left their imprint\nclearly on the companies’ capitalization structures. Simple but\nstringent tests of safety, therefore, would have warned the investor\naway from the issues that were later to default.\nAmong industrial bond issues the long-term record has been\ndifferent. Although the industrial group as a whole has shown a\nbetter growth of earning power than either the railroads or the util-\nities, it has revealed a lesser degree of inherent stability for individ-\nual companies and lines of business. Thus in the past, at least, there\nhave been persuasive reasons for confining the purchase of indus-\ntrial bonds and preferred stocks to companies that not only are of\nmajor size but also have shown an ability in the past to withstand a\nserious depression.\nFew defaults of industrial bonds have occurred since 1950, but\nthis fact is attributable in part to the absence of a major depression\nduring this long period. Since 1966 there have been adverse devel-\nopments in the financial position of many industrial companies.\nConsiderable difficulties have developed as the result of unwise\nexpansion. On the one hand this has involved large additions to\nboth bank loans and long-term debt; on the other it has frequently\nproduced operating losses instead of the expected profits. At the\nbeginning of 1971 it was calculated that in the past seven years the\ninterest payments of all nonfinancial firms had grown from $9.8\nbillion in 1963 to $26.1 billion in 1970, and that interest payments\nhad taken 29% of the aggregate profits before interest and taxes in\n1971, against only 16% in 1963.3 Obviously, the burden on many\nindividual firms had increased much more than this. Overbonded\ncompanies have become all too familiar. There is every reason to\nrepeat the caution expressed in our 1965 edition:\nWeare not quite ready to suggest that the investor may count\non an indefinite continuance of this favorable situation, and hence\nrelax his standards of bond selection in the industrial or any other\ngroup.\nwww.fx1618.com288 The Intelligent Investor\nCommon-Stock Analysis\nThe ideal form of common-stock analysis leads to a valuation of\nthe issue which can be compared with the current price to deter-\nmine whether or not the security is an attractive purchase. This val-\nuation, in turn, would ordinarily be found by estimating the\naverage earnings over a period of years in the futureand then mul-\ntiplying that estimate by an appropriate “capitalization factor.”\nThe now-standard procedure for estimating future earning\npower starts with average past data for physical volume, prices\nreceived, and operating margin. Future sales in dollars are then\nprojected on the basis of assumptions as to the amount of change in\nvolume and price level over the previous base. These estimates, in\nturn, are grounded first on general economic forecasts of gross\nnational product, and then on special calculations applicable to the\nindustry and company in question.\nAn illustration of this method of valuation may be taken from\nour 1965 edition and brought up to date by adding the sequel. The\nValue Line, a leading investment service, makes forecasts of future\nearnings and dividends by the procedure outlined above, and then\nderives a figure of “price potentiality” (or projected market value)\nby applying a valuation formula to each issue based largely on cer-\ntain past relationships. In Table 11-2 we reproduce the projections\nfor 1967–1969 made in June 1964, and compare them with the earn-\nings, and average market price actually realized in 1968 (which\napproximates the 1967–1969 period).\nThe combined forecasts proved to be somewhat on the low side,\nbut not seriously so. The corresponding predictions made six years\nbefore had turned out to be overoptimistic on earnings and divi-\ndends; but this had been offset by use of a low multiplier, with the\nresult that the “price potentiality” figure proved to be about the\nsame as the actual average price for 1963.\nThe reader will note that quite a number of the individual fore-\ncasts were wide of the mark.

Unfortunately, it appears to be almost impossible to distin-\nguish in advance between those individual forecasts which can be\nrelied upon and those which are subject to a large chance of error.\nAt bottom, this is the reason for the wide diversification practiced\nby the investment funds. For it is undoubtedly better to concen-\ntrate on one stock that you knowis going to prove highly profitable,\nrather than dilute your results to a mediocre figure, merely for\ndiversification’s sake. But this is not done, because it cannot be\ndonedependably.4The prevalence of wide diversification is in itself\na pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of “selectivity,” to which Wall\nStreet constantly pays lip service.*\nFactors Affecting the Capitalization Rate\nThough average future earnings are supposed to be the chief\ndeterminant of value, the security analyst takes into account a\nnumber of other factors of a more or less definite nature. Most of\nthese will enter into his capitalization rate, which can vary over a\nwide range, depending upon the “quality” of the stock issue. Thus,\nalthough two companies may have the same figure of expected\n*In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically mimicked\nthe Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, lest any different holdings cause\ntheir returns to deviate from that of the index. In a countertrend, some fund\ncompanies have launched what they call “focused” portfolios, which own 25\nto 50 stocks that the managers declare to be their “best ideas.” That leaves\ninvestors wondering whether the other funds run by the same managers\ncontain their worst ideas. Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do\nnot markedly outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder\nwhether the managers’ ideas are even worth having in the first place. For\nindisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification would\nbe foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a few great\nideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual investor, notdiversifying\nis foolish, since it is so difficult to select a limited number of stocks that will\ninclude most winners and exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the\ndamage any single loser can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all\nthe big winners will rise.

Let us deal briefly\nwith some of the considerations that enter into these divergent\nmultipliers.\n1. General Long-Term Prospects. No one really knows anything\nabout what will happen in the distant future, but analysts and\ninvestors have strong views on the subject just the same. These\nviews are reflected in the substantial differentials between the\nprice/earnings ratios of individual companies and of industry\ngroups. At this point we added in our 1965 edition:\nFor example, at the end of 1963 the chemical companies in the\nDJIAwere selling at considerably higher multipliers than the oil\ncompanies, indicating stronger confidence in the prospects of the\nformer than of the latter. Such distinctions made by the market are\noften soundly based, but when dictated mainly by past perfor-\nmance they are as likely to be wrong as right.\nWe shall supply here, in Table 11-3, the 1963 year-end material\non the chemical and oil company issues in the DJIA, and carry their\nearnings to the end of 1970. It will be seen that the chemical compa-\nnies, despite their high multipliers, made practically no gain in\nearnings in the period after 1963. The oil companies did much bet-\nter than the chemicals and about in line with the growth implied in\ntheir 1963 multipliers.5Thus our chemical-stock example proved to\nbe one of the cases in which the market multipliers were proven\nwrong.*\n*Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s applies to\nnearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall Street’s consensus\nview of the future for any given sector is usually either too optimistic or too\npessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its most cheery just when the\nstocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just when they are cheapest.\nThe most recent example, of course, is technology and telecommunications\nstocks, which hit record highs when their future seemed brightest in 1999\nand early 2000, and then crashed all the way through 2002. History proves\nthat Wall Street’s “expert” forecasters are equally inept at predicting the\nwww.fx1618.com4691\nsusrev\n0791\n,AIJD\neht\nni\nskcotS\nliO\ndna\nlacimehC\nfo\necnamrofreP\n3-11\nELBAT\n0791\n3691\nE/P\ndenraE\ngnisolC\nE/P\ndenraE\ngnisolC\noitaR\nerahS\nreP\necirP\noitaR\nerahS\nreP\necirP\n:seinapmoc\nlacimehC\n(cid:1)\n5.51\n65.1\n8 ⁄142\n(cid:1)\n8.91\n77.2\n55\nlacimehC\ndeillA\n8.91\n67.6\n⁄1331\n5.32\n55.6\n77\natnoP\nuD\n2\n4.51\n06.2\n04\n7.22\n66.2\n⁄106\nbedibraC\nnoinU\n4\n.eva\n3.52\n:seinapmoc\nliO\n(cid:1)\n2.01\n63.5\n⁄145\n(cid:1)\n2.31\n05.4\n⁄195\n.laC\nfo\nliO\ndradnatS\n2\n2\n4.21\n09.5\n⁄137\n0.61\n47.4\n67\n.J.N\nfo\nliO\ndradnatS\n2\n6.11\n20.3\n53\n3.61\n51.2\n53\nbocaxeT\n.eva\n3.51\n.serahs\nsrotoM\nlareneG\nfo\nnoitubirtsid\nrof\ndetsujda\nserugif\n3691a\n.stilps\nkcots\ntneuqesbus\nrof\ndetsujda\nserugif\n3691b\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 293\n2.Management.On Wall Street a great deal is constantly said on\nthis subject, but little that is really helpful. Until objective, quantita-\ntive, and reasonably reliable tests of managerial competence are\ndevised and applied, this factor will continue to be looked at\nthrough a fog. It is fair to assume that an outstandingly successful\ncompany has unusually good management. This will have shown\nitself already in the past record; it will show up again in the esti-\nmates for the next five years, and once more in the previously dis-\ncussed factor of long-term prospects. The tendency to count it still\nanother time as a separate bullish consideration can easily lead to\nexpensive overvaluations. The management factor is most useful,\nwe think, in those cases in which a recent change has taken place\nthat has not yet had the time to show its significance in the actual\nfigures.\nTwo spectacular occurrences of this kind were associated with\nthe Chrysler Motor Corporation. The first took place as far back as\n1921, when Walter Chrysler took command of the almost mori-\nbund Maxwell Motors, and in a few years made it a large and\nhighly profitable enterprise, while numerous other automobile\ncompanies were forced out of business. The second happened as\nrecently as 1962, when Chrysler had fallen far from its once high\nestate and the stock was selling at its lowest price in many years.\nThen new interests, associated with Consolidation Coal, took over\nthe reins. The earnings advanced from the 1961 figure of $1.24 per\nshare to the equivalent of $17 in 1963, and the price rose from a low\nof 381⁄ in 1962 to the equivalent of nearly 200 the very next year.6\n2\n3. Financial Strength and Capital Structure. Stock of a company\nwith a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead of the common is\nclearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with\nthe same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securi-\nties. Such factors are properly and carefully taken into account by\nsecurity analysts. A modest amount of bonds or preferred stock,\nperformance of 1) the market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) spe-\ncific stocks. As Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do\nany better are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions\nthat are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody’s forecasts, including\nhis or her own. (See Chapter 8.)\nwww.fx1618.com294 The Intelligent Investor\nhowever, is not necessarily a disadvantage to the common, nor is\nthe moderate use of seasonal bank credit. (Incidentally, a top-heavy\nstructure—too little common stock in relation to bonds and pre-\nferred—may under favorable conditions make for a huge specula-\ntiveprofit in the common. This is the factor known as “leverage.”)\n4.Dividend Record.One of the most persuasive tests of high qual-\nity is an uninterrupted record of dividend payments going back\nover many years. We think that a record of continuous dividend\npayments for the last 20 years or more is an important plus factor\nin the company’s quality rating. Indeed the defensive investor\nmight be justified in limiting his purchases to those meeting this\ntest.\n5. Current Dividend Rate. This, our last additional factor, is the\nmost difficult one to deal with in satisfactory fashion. Fortunately,\nthe majority of companies have come to follow what may be called\na standard dividend policy. This has meant the distribution of\nabout two-thirds of their average earnings, except that in the recent\nperiod of high profits and inflationary demands for more capital\nthe figure has tended to be lower. (In 1969 it was 59.5% for the\nstocks in the Dow Jones average, and 55% for all American corpo-\nrations.)* Where the dividend bears a normal relationship to the\nearnings, the valuation may be made on either basis without sub-\nstantially affecting the result. For example, a typical secondary\ncompany with expected average earnings of $3 and an expected\ndividend of $2 may be valued at either 12 times its earnings or 18\ntimes its dividend, to yield a value of 36 in both cases.\nHowever, an increasing number of growth companies are\ndeparting from the once standard policy of paying out 60% or\nmore of earnings in dividends, on the grounds that the sharehold-\n*This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has dropped consid-\nerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged investors from\nseeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of year-end 2002, the\npayout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S & P 500-stock index and, as recently\nas April 2000, it hit an all-time low of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/\nresearch/fundamentals.asp.) We discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in\nthe commentary on Chapter 19.\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 295\ners’ interests will be better served by retaining nearly all the profits\nto finance expansion. The issue presents problems and requires\ncareful distinctions. We have decided to defer our discussion of the\nvital question of proper dividend policy to a later section—Chapter\n19—where we shall deal with it as a part of the general problem of\nmanagement-shareholder relations.\nCapitalization Rates for Growth Stocks\nMost of the writing of security analysts on formal appraisals\nrelates to the valuation of growth stocks. Our study of the various\nmethods has led us to suggest a foreshortened and quite simple\nformula for the valuation of growth stocks, which is intended to\nproduce figures fairly close to those resulting from the more\nrefined mathematical calculations. Our formula is:\nValue = Current (Normal) Earnings (cid:1)(8.5 plus twice\nthe expected annual growth rate)\nThe growth figure should be that expected over the next seven to\nten years.7\nIn Table 11-4 we show how our formula works out for various\nrates of assumed growth. It is easy to make the converse calcula-\ntion and to determine what rate of growth is anticipated by the cur-\nrent market price, assuming our formula is valid. In our last\nedition we made that calculation for the DJIAand for six important\nstock issues. These figures are reproduced in Table 11-5. We com-\nmented at the time:\nThe difference between the implicit 32.4% annual growth rate\nfor Xerox and the extremely modest 2.8% for General Motors is\nindeed striking. It is explainable in part by the stock market’s feel-\ning that General Motors’ 1963 earnings—the largest for any corpo-\nration in history—can be maintained with difficulty and exceeded\nonly modestly at best. The price earnings ratio of Xerox, on the\nother hand, is quite representative of speculative enthusiasm fas-\ntened upon a company of great achievement and perhaps still\ngreater promise.\nThe implicit or expected growth rate of 5.1% for the DJIAcom-\nwww.fx1618.com,setaR\nhtworG\ndetcepxE\nno\ndesaB\nsreilpitluM\nsgninraE\nlaunnA\n4-11\nELBAT\nalumroF\ndeifilpmiS\na\nno\ndesaB\n%0.02\n%3.41\n%0.01\n%2.7\n%0.5\n%5.2\n%0.0\netar\nhtworg\ndetcepxE\n%0.913\n%0.082\n%0.951\n%0.001\n%0.36\n%0.82\n0.0\nsraey\n01\nni htworG\n5.84\n1.73\n5.82\n9.22\n5.81\n5.31\n5.8\nsgninrae\ntnerruc\nfo\nreilpitluM\n9691\nrebmeceD\ndna\n3691\nrebmeceD\n,setaR\nhtworG\ndetcepxE\nro\nticilpmI\n5-11\nELBAT\nadetcejorP\nlaunnA\nlautcA\ndenraE\nadetcejorP\n,etaR\nhtworG\n,oitaR\nE/P\n,htworG\nerahS\nreP\n,etaR\nhtworG\n,oitaR\nE/P\n9691\n9691\n9691–3691\n9691\n3691\n3691\n3691\neussI\n%8.1\n(cid:1)\n2.21\n%57.4\n00.4\n30.3\n%3.7\n(cid:1)\n0.32\n.leT\n&\n.leT\nnaciremA\n0.6\n4.02\n0.4\nb97.3\n00.3\n3.01\n0.92\ncirtcelE\nlareneG\n6.1\n6.11\n71.1\n59.5\n55.5\n8.2\n1.41\nsrotoM\nlareneG\n9.71\n4.44\n0.61\n12.8\nc84.3\n0.51\n5.83\nMBI\n1.1\n8.01\n1.0\n03.2\nc92.2\n4.2\n2.31\nretsevraH\nlanoitanretnI\n2.12\n8.05\n2.92\n80.2\nc83.\n4.23\n0.52\nxoreX\n8.2\n0.41\n5.5\n20.75\n11.14\n1.5\n6.81\nAIJD\n.592\n.p\nno\nalumrof\nno\ndesaBa\n.ekirts\nyb\ndecuder\nerew\nsgninrae\n9691\necnis\n,0791\ndna\n8691\nfo egarevAb\n.stilps\nkcots\nrof\ndetsujdAc\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 297\npares with an actual annual increase of 3.4% (compounded)\nbetween 1951–1953 and 1961–1963.\nWeshould have added a caution somewhat as follows: The val-\nuations of expected high-growth stocks are necessarily on the low\nside, if we were to assume these growth rates will actually be real-\nized. In fact, according to the arithmetic, if a company could be\nassumed to grow at a rate of 8% or more indefinitelyin the future its\nvalue would be infinite, and no price would be too high to pay for\nthe shares. What the valuer actually does in these cases is to intro-\nduce a margin of safetyinto his calculations—somewhat as an engi-\nneer does in his specifications for a structure. On this basis the\npurchases would realize his assigned objective (in 1963, a future\noverall return of 71⁄% per annum) even if the growth rate actually\n2\nrealized proved substantially less than that projected in the for-\nmula. Of course, then, if that rate were actually realized the\ninvestor would be sure to enjoy a handsome additional return.\nThere is really no way of valuing a high-growth company (with\nan expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in which the analyst\ncan make realistic assumptions of both the proper multiplier for\nthe current earnings and the expectable multiplier for the future\nearnings.\nAs it happened the actual growth for Xerox and IBM proved\nvery close to the high rates implied from our formula. As just\nexplained, this fine showing inevitably produced a large advance\nin the price of both issues. The growth of the DJIAitself was also\nabout as projected by the 1963 closing market price. But the moder-\nate rate of 5% did not involve the mathematical dilemma of Xerox\nand IBM. It turned out that the 23% price rise to the end of 1970,\nplus the 28% in aggregate dividend return received, gave not far\nfrom the 71⁄% annual overall gain posited in our formula. In the\n2\ncase of the other four companies it may suffice to say that their\ngrowth did not equal the expectations implied in the 1963 price\nand that their quotations failed to rise as much as the DJIA. Warn-\ning: This material is supplied for illustrative purposes only, and\nbecause of the inescapable necessity in security analysis to project\nthe future growth rate for most companies studied. Let the reader\nnot be misled into thinking that such projections have any high\ndegree of reliability or, conversely, that future prices can be\nwww.fx1618.com298 The Intelligent Investor\ncounted on to behave accordingly as the prophecies are realized,\nsurpassed, or disappointed.\nWeshould point out that any “scientific,” or at least reasonably\ndependable, stock evaluation based on anticipated future results\nmust take future interest rates into account. A given schedule of\nexpected earnings, or dividends, would have a smaller present\nvalue if we assume a higher than if we assume a lower interest\nstructure.* Such assumptions have always been difficult to make\nwith any degree of confidence, and the recent violent swings in\nlong-term interest rates render forecasts of this sort almost pre-\nsumptuous. Hence we have retained our old formula above, sim-\nply because no new one would appear more plausible.\nIndustry Analysis\nBecause the general prospects of the enterprise carry major\nweight in the establishment of market prices, it is natural for the\nsecurity analyst to devote a great deal of attention to the economic\nposition of the industry and of the individual company in its\nindustry. Studies of this kind can go into unlimited detail. They are\nsometimes productive of valuable insights into important factors\nthat will be operative in the future and are insufficiently appreci-\nated by the current market. Where a conclusion of that kind can be\ndrawn with a fair degree of confidence, it affords a sound basis for\ninvestment decisions.\nOur own observation, however, leads us to minimize some-\nwhat the practical value of most of the industry studies that are\nmade available to investors. The material developed is ordinarily\nof a kind with which the public is already fairly familiar and that\nhas already exerted considerable influence on market quotations.\n*Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount of money\ndoubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in just over 10 years.\nWhen interest rates are high, the amount of money you need to set aside\ntoday to reach a given value in the future is lower—since those high interest\nrates will enable it to grow at a more rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates\ntoday makes a future stream of earnings or dividends less valuable—since\nthe alternative of investing in bonds has become relatively more attractive.\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 299\nRarely does one find a brokerage-house study that points out,\nwith a convincing array of facts, that a popular industry is head-\ning for a fall or that an unpopular one is due to prosper. Wall\nStreet’s view of the longer future is notoriously fallible, and this\nnecessarily applies to that important part of its investigations\nwhich is directed toward the forecasting of the course of profits in\nvarious industries.\nWe must recognize, however, that the rapid and pervasive\ngrowth of technology in recent years is not without major effect on\nthe attitude and the labors of the security analyst. More so than in\nthe past, the progress or retrogression of the typical company in the\ncoming decade may depend on its relation to new products and\nnew processes, which the analyst may have a chance to study and\nevaluate in advance. Thus there is doubtless a promising area for\neffective work by the analyst, based on field trips, interviews with\nresearch men, and on intensive technological investigation on his\nown. There are hazards connected with investment conclusions\nderived chiefly from such glimpses into the future, and not sup-\nported by presently demonstrable value. Yet there are perhaps\nequal hazards in sticking closely to the limits of value set by sober\ncalculations resting on actual results. The investor cannot have it\nboth ways. He can be imaginative and play for the big profits that\nare the reward for vision proved sound by the event; but then he\nmust run a substantial risk of major or minor miscalculation. Or he\ncan be conservative, and refuse to pay more than a minor premium\nfor possibilities as yet unproved; but in that case he must be pre-\npared for the later contemplation of golden opportunities foregone.\nATwo-Part Appraisal Process\nLet us return for a moment to the idea of valuation or appraisal\nof a common stock, which we began to discuss above on p. 288. A\ngreat deal of reflection on the subject has led us to conclude that\nthis better be done quite differently than is now the established\npractice. We suggest that analysts work out first what we call the\n“past-performance value,” which is based solely on the past\nrecord. This would indicate what the stock would be worth—\nabsolutely, or as a percentage of the DJIAor of the S & Pcompos-\nite—if it is assumed that its relative past performance will continue\nwww.fx1618.com300 The Intelligent Investor\nunchanged in the future. (This includes the assumption that its rel-\native growth rate, as shown in the last seven years, will also con-\ntinue unchanged over the next seven years.) This process could be\ncarried out mechanically by applying a formula that gives individ-\nual weights to past figures for profitability, stability, and growth,\nand also for current financial condition. The second part of the\nanalysis should consider to what extent the value based solely on\npast performance should be modified because of new conditions\nexpected in the future.\nSuch a procedure would divide the work between senior and\njunior analysts as follows: (1) The senior analyst would set up the\nformula to apply to all companies generally for determining past-\nperformance value. (2) The junior analysts would work up such\nfactors for the designated companies—pretty much in mechanical\nfashion. (3) The senior analyst would then determine to what\nextent a company’s performance—absolute or relative—is likely to\ndiffer from its past record, and what change should be made in\nthe value to reflect such anticipated changes. It would be best if the\nsenior analyst’s report showed both the original valuation and the\nmodified one, with his reasons for the change.\nIs a job of this kind worth doing? Our answer is in the affirma-\ntive, but our reasons may appear somewhat cynical to the reader.\nWedoubt whether the valuations so reached will prove sufficiently\ndependable in the case of the typical industrial company, great or\nsmall. We shall illustrate the difficulties of this job in our discus-\nsion of Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) in the next\nchapter. Nonetheless it should be done for such common stocks.\nWhy? First, many security analysts are bound to make current or\nprojected valuations, as part of their daily work. The method we\npropose should be an improvement on those generally followed\ntoday. Secondly, because it should give useful experience and\ninsight to the analysts who practice this method. Thirdly, because\nwork of this kind could produce an invaluable body of recorded\nexperience—as has long been the case in medicine—that may lead\nto better methods of procedure and a useful knowledge of its pos-\nsibilities and limitations. The public-utility stocks might well\nprove an important area in which this approach will show real\npragmatic value. Eventually the intelligent analyst will confine\nhimself to those groups in which the future appears reasonably\nwww.fx1618.comSecurity Analysis for theLay Investor 301\npredictable,* or where the margin of safety of past-performance\nvalue over current price is so large that he can take his chances on\nfuture variations—as he does in selecting well-secured senior secu-\nrities.\nIn subsequent chapters we shall supply concrete examples of\nthe application of analytical techniques.

What makes one company worth 10 times earnings and\nanother worth 20 times? How can you be reasonably sure that you are\nnot overpaying for an apparently rosy future that turns out to be a\nmurky nightmare?\nGraham feels that five elements are decisive.1He summarizes them as:\n• the company’s “general long-term prospects”\n• the quality of its management\n• its financial strength and capital structure\n• its dividend record\n• and its current dividend rate.\nLet’s look at these factors in the light of today’s market.\nThe long-term prospects. Nowadays, the intelligent investor\nshould begin by downloading at least five years’ worth of annual\nreports (Form 10-K) from the company’s website or from the EDGAR\n1Because so few of today’s individual investors buy—or should buy—individ-\nual bonds, we will limit this discussion to stock analysis.

What makes this company grow? Where do (and where will) its\nprofits come from? Among the problems to watch for:\n• The company is a “serial acquirer.” An average of more than two\nor three acquisitions a year is a sign of potential trouble. After all,\nif the company itself would rather buy the stock of other busi-\nnesses than invest in its own, shouldn’t you take the hint and look\nelsewhere too? And check the company’s track record as an\nacquirer. Watch out for corporate bulimics—firms that wolf down\nbig acquisitions, only to end up vomiting them back out. Lucent,\nMattel, Quaker Oats, and Tyco International are among the com-\npanies that have had to disgorge acquisitions at sickening losses.\nOther firms take chronic write-offs, or accounting charges proving\nthat they overpaid for their past acquisitions. That’s a bad omen\nfor future deal making.3\n• The company is an OPM addict, borrowing debt or selling stock\nto raise boatloads of Other People’s Money. These fat infusions of\nOPM are labeled “cash from financing activities” on the statement\nof cash flows in the annual report. They can make a sick company\nappear to be growing even if its underlying businesses are not\ngenerating enough cash—as Global Crossing and WorldCom\nshowed not long ago.4\n2You should also get at least one year’s worth of quarterly reports (on Form\n10-Q). By definition, we are assuming that you are an “enterprising” investor\nwilling to devote a considerable amount of effort to your portfolio. If the\nsteps in this chapter sound like too much work to you, then you are not tem-\nperamentally well suited to picking your own stocks. You cannot reliably\nobtain the results you imagine unless you put in the kind of effort we\ndescribe.\n3You can usually find details on acquisitions in the “Management’s Discus-\nsion and Analysis” section of Form 10-K; cross-check it against the foot-\nnotes to the financial statements. For more on “serial acquirers,” see the\ncommentary on Chapter 12.\n4Todetermine whether a company is an OPM addict, read the “Statement\nof Cash Flows” in the financial statements. This page breaks down the\nwww.fx1618.com304 Commentary on Chapter 11\n• The company is a Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer (or\na handful) for most of its revenues. In October 1999, fiber-optics\nmaker Sycamore Networks, Inc. sold stock to the public for the\nfirst time. The prospectus revealed that one customer, Williams\nCommunications, accounted for 100% of Sycamore’s $11 million\nin total revenues. Traders blithely valued Sycamore’s shares at\n$15 billion. Unfortunately, Williams went bankrupt just over two\nyears later. Although Sycamore picked up other customers, its\nstock lost 97% between 2000 and 2002.\nAs you study the sources of growth and profit, stay on the lookout\nfor positives as well as negatives. Among the good signs:\n• The company has a wide “moat,” or competitive advantage. Like\ncastles, some companies can easily be stormed by marauding\ncompetitors, while others are almost impregnable. Several forces\ncan widen a company’s moat: a strong brand identity (think of\nHarley Davidson, whose buyers tattoo the company’s logo onto\ntheir bodies); a monopoly or near-monopoly on the market;\neconomies of scale,or the ability to supply huge amounts of goods\nor services cheaply (consider Gillette, which churns out razor\nblades by the billion); a unique intangible asset (think of Coca-\nCola, whose secret formula for flavored syrup has no real physical\nvalue but maintains a priceless hold on consumers); a resistance\nto substitution(most businesses have no alternative to electricity,\nso utility companies are unlikely to be supplanted any time soon).5\ncompany’s cash inflows and outflows into “operating activities,” “invest-\ning activities,” and “financing activities.” If cash from operating activities is\nconsistently negative, while cash from financing activities is consistently\npositive, the company has a habit of craving more cash than its own\nbusinesses can produce—and you should not join the “enablers” of that\nhabitual abuse. For more on Global Crossing, see the commentary on\nChapter 12. For more on WorldCom, see the sidebar in the commentary on\nChapter 6.\n5For more insight into “moats,” see the classic book Competitive Strategy\nby Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter (Free Press, New\nYork, 1998).\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 11 305\n• The company is a marathoner, not a sprinter. By looking back at\nthe income statements, you can see whether revenues and net\nearnings have grown smoothly and steadily over the previous 10\nyears. A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journalconfirmed\nwhat other studies (and the sad experience of many investors)\nhave shown: that the fastest-growing companies tend to overheat\nand flame out.6If earnings are growing at a long-term rate of 10%\npretax (or 6% to 7% after-tax), that may be sustainable. But the\n15% growth hurdle that many companies set for themselves is\ndelusional. And an even higher rate—or a sudden burst of growth\nin one or two years—is all but certain to fade, just like an inexperi-\nenced marathoner who tries to run the whole race as if it were a\n100-meter dash.\n• The company sows and reaps. No matter how good its products\nor how powerful its brands, a company must spend some money\nto develop new business. While research and development\nspending is not a source of growth today, it may well be tomor-\nrow—particularly if a firm has a proven record of rejuvenating its\nbusinesses with new ideas and equipment. The average budget\nfor research and development varies across industries and com-\npanies. In 2002, Procter & Gamble spent about 4% of its net\nsales on R & D, while 3M spent 6.5% and Johnson & Johnson\n10.9%. In the long run, a company that spends nothing on R & D\nis at least as vulnerable as one that spends too much.\nThe quality and conduct of management. A company’s execu-\ntives should say what they will do, then do what they said. Read the\npast annual reports to see what forecasts the managers made and\nif they fulfilled them or fell short. Managers should forthrightly admit\ntheir failures and take responsibility for them, rather than blaming\nall-purpose scapegoats like “the economy,” “uncertainty,” or “weak\ndemand.” Check whether the tone and substance of the chairman’s\nletter stay constant, or fluctuate with the latest fads on Wall Street.\n(Pay special attention to boom years like 1999: Did the executives of\n6See Cyrus A. Ramezani, Luc Soenen, and Alan Jung, “Growth, Corporate\nProfitability, and Value Creation,” Financial Analysts Journal, November/\nDecember, 2002, pp. 56–67; also available at http://cyrus.cob.calpoly.edu/.\nwww.fx1618.com306 Commentary on Chapter 11\na cement or underwear company suddenly declare that they were “on\nthe leading edge of the transformative software revolution”?)\nThese questions can also help you determine whether the people\nwho run the company will act in the interests of the people who own\nthe company:\n• Are they looking out for No. 1?\nA firm that pays its CEO $100 million in a year had better have a\nvery good reason. (Perhaps he discovered—and patented—the Foun-\ntain of Youth? Or found El Dorado and bought it for $1 an acre? Or\ncontacted life on another planet and negotiated a contract obligat-\ning the aliens to buy all their supplies from only one company on\nEarth?) Otherwise, this kind of obscenely obese payday suggests\nthat the firm is run by the managers, forthe managers.\nIf a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock\noptions for insiders, stay away. In this switcheroo, a company can-\ncels existing (and typically worthless) stock options for employees\nand executives, then replaces them with new ones at advanta-\ngeous prices. If their value is never allowed to go to zero, while\ntheir potential profit is always infinite, how can options encourage\ngood stewardship of corporate assets? Any established company\nthat reprices options—as dozens of high-tech firms have—is a dis-\ngrace. And any investor who buys stock in such a company is a\nsheep begging to be sheared.\nBy looking in the annual report for the mandatory footnote\nabout stock options, you can see how large the “option overhang”\nis. AOL Time Warner, for example, reported in the front of its\nannual report that it had 4.5 billion shares of common stock out-\nstanding as of December 31, 2002—but a footnote in the bowels\nof the report reveals that the company had issued options on 657\nmillion more shares. So AOL’s future earnings will have to be\ndivided among 15% more shares. You should factor in the poten-\ntial flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimate\na company’s future value.7\n“Form 4,” available through the EDGAR database at www.sec.\n7Jason Zweig is an employee of AOL Time Warner and holds options in the\ncompany.

There can be legitimate reasons for\nan insider to sell—diversification, a bigger house, a divorce settle-\nment—but repeated big sales are a bright red flag. A manager\ncan’t legitimately be your partner if he keeps selling while you’re\nbuying.\n• Are they managers or promoters?\nExecutives should spend most of their time managing their\ncompany in private, not promoting it to the investing public. All too\noften, CEOs complain that their stock is undervalued no matter\nhow high it goes—forgetting Graham’s insistence that managers\nshould try to keep the stock price from going either too low ortoo\nhigh.8 Meanwhile, all too many chief financial officers give “earn-\nings guidance,” or guesstimates of the company’s quarterly prof-\nits. And some firms are hype-o-chondriacs, constantly spewing\nforth press releases boasting of temporary, trivial, or hypothetical\n“opportunities.”\nA handful of companies—including Coca-Cola, Gillette, and\nUSA Interactive—have begun to “just say no” to Wall Street’s\nshort-term thinking. These few brave outfits are providing more\ndetail about their current budgets and long-term plans, while\nrefusing to speculate about what the next 90 days might hold.\n(For a model of how a company can communicate candidly and\nfairly with its shareholders, go to the EDGAR database at\nwww.sec.gov and view the 8-K filings made by Expeditors In-\nternational of Washington, which periodically posts its superb\nquestion-and-answer dialogues with shareholders there.)\nFinally, ask whether the company’s accounting practices are\ndesigned to make its financial results transparent—or opaque. If\n“nonrecurring” charges keep recurring, “extraordinary” items crop\nup so often that they seem ordinary, acronyms like EBITDA take\npriority over net income, or “pro forma” earnings are used to cloak\nactual losses, you may be looking at a firm that has not yet learned\nhow to put its shareholders’ long-term interests first.9\n8See note 19 in the commentary on Chapter 19, p. 508.\n9For more on these issues, see the commentary on Chapter 12 and the\nsuperb essay by Joseph Fuller and Michael C. Jensen, “Just Say No to Wall\nStreewt,” wat whtt.pf:x//p1a6pe1rs8.s.scrno.cmom.308 Commentary on Chapter 11\nFinancial strength and capital structure.The most basic possible\ndefinition of a good business is this: It generates more cash than it\nconsumes. Good managers keep finding ways of putting that cash to\nproductive use. In the long run, companies that meet this definition are\nvirtually certain to grow in value, no matter what the stock market\ndoes.\nStart by reading the statement of cash flows in the company’s\nannual report. See whether cash from operations has grown steadily\nthroughout the past 10 years. Then you can go further. Warren Buffett\nhas popularized the concept of owner earnings, or net income plus\namortization and depreciation, minus normal capital expenditures. As\nportfolio manager Christopher Davis of Davis Selected Advisors puts\nit, “If you owned 100% of this business, how much cash would you\nhave in your pocket at the end of the year?” Because it adjusts for\naccounting entries like amortization and depreciation that do not\naffect the company’s cash balances, owner earnings can be a better\nmeasure than reported net income. To fine-tune the definition of owner\nearnings, you should also subtract from reported net income:\n• any costs of granting stock options, which divert earnings away\nfrom existing shareholders into the hands of new inside owners\n• any “unusual,” “nonrecurring,” or “extraordinary” charges\n• any “income” from the company’s pension fund.\nIf owner earnings per share have grown at a steady average of at\nleast 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company is a stable gen-\nerator of cash, and its prospects for growth are good.\nNext, look at the company’s capital structure. Turn to the balance\nsheet to see how much debt (including preferred stock) the company\nhas; in general, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital.\nIn the footnotes to the financial statements, determine whether the\nlong-term debt is fixed-rate (with constant interest payments) or vari-\nable (with payments that fluctuate, which could become costly if inter-\nest rates rise).\nLook in the annual report for the exhibit or statement showing the\n“ratio of earnings to fixed charges.” That exhibit to Amazon.com’s\n2002 annual report shows that Amazon’s earnings fell $145 million\nshort of covering its interest costs. In the future, Amazon will either\nhave to earn much more from its operations or find a way to borrow\nmoney awt wlowwer. frxat1es6. 1O8th.ecrowimse, the company could end up beingCommentary on Chapter 11 309\nowned not by its shareholders but by its bondholders, who can lay\nclaim to Amazon’s assets if they have no other way of securing the\ninterest payments they are owed. (To be fair, Amazon’s ratio of earn-\nings to fixed charges was far healthier in 2002 than two years earlier,\nwhen earnings fell $1.1 billion short of covering debt payments.)\nA few words on dividends and stock policy (for more, please see\nChapter 19):\n• The burden of proof is on the company to show that you are better\noff if it does not pay a dividend. If the firm has consistently outper-\nformed the competition in good markets and bad, the managers are\nclearly putting the cash to optimal use. If, however, business is fal-\ntering or the stock is underperforming its rivals, then the managers\nand directors are misusing the cash by refusing to pay a dividend.\n• Companies that repeatedly split their shares—and hype those\nsplits in breathless press releases—treat their investors like dolts.\nLike Yogi Berra, who wanted his pizza cut into four slices because\n“I don’t think I can eat eight,” the shareholders who love stock\nsplits miss the point. Two shares of a stock at $50 are not worth\nmore than one share at $100. Managers who use splits to pro-\nmote their stock are aiding and abetting the worst instincts of the\ninvesting public, and the intelligent investor will think twice before\nturning any money over to such condescending manipulators.10\n• Companies should buy back their shares when they are cheap—\nnot when they are at or near record highs. Unfortunately, it\nrecently has become all too common for companies to repur-\nchase their stock when it is overpriced. There is no more cynical\nwaste of a company’s cash—since the real purpose of that maneu-\nver is to enable top executives to reap multimillion-dollar paydays\nby selling their own stock options in the name of “enhancing\nshareholder value.”\nA substantial amount of anecdotal evidence, in fact, suggests that\nmanagers who talk about “enhancing shareholder value” seldom do.\nIn investing, as with life in general, ultimate victory usually goes to the\ndoers, not to the talkers.\n10Stock splits are discussed further in the commentary on Chapter 13.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 12\nThings to Consider About\nPer-Share Earnings\nT\nhis chapter will begin with two pieces of advice to the investor\nthat cannot avoid being contradictory in their implications. The\nfirst is: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. The second is:\nIf you do pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby\ntraps in the per-share figures. If our first warning were followed\nstrictly the second would be unnecessary. But it is too much to\nexpect that most shareholders can relate all their common-stock\ndecisions to the long-term record and the long-term prospects. The\nquarterly figures, and especially the annual figures, receive major\nattention in financial circles, and this emphasis can hardly fail to\nhave its impact on the investor’s thinking. He may well need some\neducation in this area, for it abounds in misleading possibilities.\nAs this chapter is being written the earnings report of Alu-\nminum Company of America (ALCOA) for 1970 appears in the\nWall Street Journal.The first figures shown are\n1970 1969\nShare earningsa $5.20 $5.58\nThe little aat the outset is explained in a footnote to refer to “pri-\nmary earnings,” before special charges. There is much more foot-\nnote material; in fact it occupies twice as much space as do the\nbasic figures themselves.\nFor the December quarter alone, the “earnings per share” are\ngiven as $1.58 in 1970 against $1.56 in 1969.\nThe investor or speculator interested in ALCOAshares, reading\nwww.fx1618.com\n310Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 311\nthose figures, might say to himself: “Not so bad. I knew that 1970\nwas a recession year in aluminum. But the fourth quarter shows a\ngain over 1969, with earnings at the rate of $6.32 per year. Let me\nsee. The stock is selling at 62. Why, that’s less than ten times earn-\nings. That makes it look pretty cheap, compared with 16 times for\nInternational Nickel, etc., etc.”\nBut if our investor-speculator friend had bothered to read all the\nmaterial in the footnote, he would have found that instead of one\nfigure of earnings per share for the year 1970 there were actually\nfour,viz.:\n1970 1969\nPrimary earnings $5.20 $5.58\nNet income (after special charges) 4.32 5.58\nFully diluted, before special charges 5.01 5.35\nFully diluted, after special charges 4.19 5.35\nFor the fourth quarter alone only two figures are given:\nPrimary earnings $1.58 $1.56\nNet income (after special charges) .70 1.56\nWhat do all these additional earnings mean? Which earnings are\ntrue earnings for the year and the December quarter? If the latter\nshould be taken at 70 cents—the net income after special charges—\nthe annual rate would be $2.80 instead of $6.32, and the price 62\nwould be “22 times earnings,” instead of the 10 times we started\nwith.\nPart of the question as to the “true earnings” of ALCOAcan be\nanswered quite easily. The reduction from $5.20 to $5.01, to allow\nfor the effects of “dilution,” is clearly called for. ALCOAhas a large\nbond issue convertible into common stock; to calculate the “earn-\ning power” of the common, based on the 1970 results, it must be\nassumed that the conversion privilege will be exercised if it should\nprove profitable to the bondholders to do so. The amount involved\nin the ALCOA picture is relatively small, and hardly deserves\ndetailed comment. But in other cases, making allowance for con-\nversion rights—and the existence of stock-purchase warrants—can\nwww.fx1618.com312 The Intelligent Investor\nreduce the apparent earnings by half, or more. We shall present\nexamples of a really significant dilution factor below (page 411).\n(The financial services are not always consistent in their allowance\nfor the dilution factor in their reporting and analyses.)*\nLet us turn now to the matter of “special charges.” This figure of\n$18,800,000, or 88 cents per share, deducted in the fourth quarter, is\nnot unimportant. Is it to be ignored entirely, or fully recognized as\nan earnings reduction, or partly recognized and partly ignored?\nThe alert investor might ask himself also how does it happen that\nthere was a virtual epidemic of such special charge-offs appearing\nafter the close of 1970, but not in previous years? Could there pos-\nsibly have been some fine Italian hands† at work with the account-\ning—but always, of course, within the limits of the permissible?\nWhen we look closely we may find that such losses, charged off\nbefore they actually occur, can be charmed away, as it were, with\nno unhappy effect on either past or future “primary earnings.” In\nsome extreme cases they might be availed of to make subsequent\nearnings appear nearly twice as large as in reality—by a more or\nless prestidigitous treatment of the tax credit involved.\n*“Dilution” is one of many words that describe stocks in the language of\nfluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to be “liquid.” When\na company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its shares. And, in earlier days, a\ncompany that drastically diluted its shares (with large amounts of convert-\nible debt or multiple offerings of common stock) was said to have “watered”\nits stock. This term is believed to have originated with the legendary market\nmanipulator Daniel Drew (1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He\nwould drive his cattle south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt\nalong the way. When they got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge\nvolumes of water to slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market,\nwhere the water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That\nenabled him to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by\nthe pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively\nissuing new shares without warning.\n†Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant Italian\nstone carvers who ornamented the otherwise plain facades of buildings\nthroughout New York in the early 1900s. Accountants, likewise, can trans-\nform simple financial facts into intricate and even incomprehensible patterns.\nwww.fx1618.comThings to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 313\nIn dealing with ALCOA’s special charges, the first thing to\nestablish is how they arose. The footnotes are specific enough. The\ndeductions came from four sources, viz.:\n1. Management’s estimate of the anticipated costs of closing\ndown the manufactured products division.\n2. Ditto for closing down ALCOACastings Co.’s plants.\n3. Ditto for losses in phasing out ALCOACredit Co.\n4. Also, estimated costs of $5.3 million associated with comple-\ntion of the contract for a “curtain wall.”\nAll of these items are related to future costs and losses. It is easy\nto say that they are not part of the “regular operating results” of\n1970—but if so, where do they belong? Are they so “extraordinary\nand nonrecurring” as to belong nowhere? Awidespread enterprise\nsuch as ALCOA, doing a $1.5 billion business annually, must have\na lot of divisions, departments, affiliates, and the like. Would it not\nbe normal rather than extraordinary for one or more to prove\nunprofitable, and to require closing down? Similarly for such\nthings as a contract to build a wall. Suppose that any time a com-\npany had a loss on any part of its business it had the bright idea of\ncharging it off as a “special item,” and thus reporting its “primary\nearnings” per share so as to include only its profitable contracts\nand operations? Like King Edward VII’s sundial, that marked only\nthe “sunny hours.”*\n*The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay by the\nEnglish writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near Venice that\nbore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas,or “I count only the hours\nthat are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad news from their\nfinancial results on the pretext that negative events are “extraordinary” or\n“nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt, who urged his readers “to\ntake no note of time but by its benefits, to watch only for the smiles and ne-\nglect the frowns of fate, to compose our lives of bright and gentle moments,\nturning away to the sunny side of things, and letting the rest slip from our\nimaginations, unheeded or forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.\n1827.) Unfortunately, investors must always count the sunny and dark hours\nalike.\nwww.fx1618.com314 The Intelligent Investor\nThe reader should note two ingenious aspects of the ALCOA\nprocedure we have been discussing. The first is that by anticipating\nfuture losses the company escapes the necessity of allocating the\nlosses themselves to an identifiable year. They don’t belong in\n1970, because they were not actually taken in that year. And they\nwon’t be shown in the year when they are actually taken, because\nthey have already been provided for. Neat work, but might it not\nbe just a little misleading?\nThe ALCOAfootnote says nothing about the future tax saving\nfrom these losses. (Most other statements of this sort state specifi-\ncally that only the “after-tax effect” has been charged off.) If the\nALCOAfigure represents future losses before the related tax credit,\nthen not only will future earnings be freed from the weight of these\ncharges (as they are actually incurred), but they will be increasedby\na tax credit of some 50% thereof. It is difficult to believe that the\naccounts will be handled that way. But it is a fact that certain com-\npanies which have had large losses in the past have been able to\nreport future earnings without charging the normal taxes against\nthem, in that way making a very fine profits appearance indeed—\nbased paradoxically enough on their past disgraces. (Tax credits\nresulting from past years’losses are now being shown separately as\n“special items,” but they will enter into future statistics as part of\nthe final “net-income” figure. However, a reserve now set up for\nfuturelosses, if netof expected tax credit, should not create an addi-\ntion of this sort to the net income of later years.)\nThe other ingenious feature is the use by ALCOA and many\nother companies of the 1970 year-end for making these special\ncharge-offs. The stock market took what appeared to be a blood\nbath in the first half of 1970. Everyone expected relatively poor\nresults for the year for most companies. Wall Street was now antic-\nipating better results in 1971, 1972, etc. What a nice arrangement,\nthen, to charge as much as possible to the bad year, which had\nalready been written off mentally and had virtually receded into\nthe past, leaving the way clear for nicely fattened figures in the\nnext few years! Perhaps this is good accounting, good business pol-\nicy, and good for management-shareholder relationships. But we\nhave lingering doubts.\nThe combination of widely (or should it be wildly?) diversified\noperations with the impulse to clean house at the end of 1970 has\nwww.fx1618.comThings to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 315\nproduced some strange-looking footnotes to the annual reports.\nThe reader may be amused by the following explanation given by\na New York Stock Exchange company (which shall remain\nunnamed) of its “special items” aggregating $2,357,000, or about a\nthird of the income before charge-offs: “Consists of provision for\nclosing Spalding United Kingdom operations; provision for reorga-\nnizational expenses of a division; costs of selling a small baby-\npants and bib manufacturing company, disposing of part interest\nin a Spanish car-leasing facility, and liquidation of a ski-boot opera-\ntion.”*\nYears ago the strong companies used to set up “contingency\nreserves” out of the profits of good yearsto absorb some of the bad\neffects of depression years to come. The underlying idea was to\nequalize the reported earnings, more or less, and to improve the\nstability factor in the company’s record. Aworthy motive, it would\nseem; but the accountants quite rightly objected to the practice as\nmisstating the true earnings. They insisted that each year’s results\nbe presented as they were, good or bad, and the shareholders and\nanalysts be allowed to do the averaging or equalizing for them-\nselves. We seem now to be witnessing the opposite phenomenon,\nwith everyone charging off as much as possible against forgotten\n1970, so as to start 1971 with a slate not only clean but specially\nprepared to show pleasing per-share figures in the coming years.\nIt is time to return to our first question. What then were the true\nearnings of ALCOAin 1970? The accurate answer would be: The\n$5.01 per share, after “dilution,” less that part of the 82 cents of\n“special charges” that may properly be attributed to occurrences in\n1970. But we do not know what that portion is, and hence we cannot\nproperly state the true earnings for the year.The management and the\nauditors should have given us their best judgment on this point,\nbut they did not do so.

This evidently they will not\ndo either, since they have already conveniently disposed of the\nentire sum as a 1970 special charge.\nThe more seriously investors take the per-share earnings figures\nas published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their guard\nagainst accounting factors of one kind and another that may impair\nthe true comparability of the numbers. We have mentioned three\nsorts of these factors: the use of special charges,which may never be\nreflected in the per-share earnings, the reduction in the normal\nincome-tax deduction by reason of past losses, and the dilution fac-\ntor implicit in the existence of substantial amounts of convertible\nsecurities or warrants.1 A fourth item that has had a significant\neffect on reported earnings in the past is the method of treating\ndepreciation—chiefly as between the “straight-line” and the\n“accelerated” schedules. We refrain from details here. But as an\nexample current as we write, let us mention the 1970 report of\nTrane Co. This firm showed an increase of nearly 20% in per-share\nearnings over 1969—$3.29 versus $2.76—but half of this came from\nreturning to the older straight-line depreciation rates, less burden-\nsome on earnings than the accelerated method used the year\nbefore. (The company will continue to use the accelerated rate on\nits income-tax return, thus deferring income-tax payments on the\ndifference.) Still another factor, important at times, is the choice\nbetween charging off research and development costs in the year\nthey are incurred or amortizing them over a period of years.\nFinally, let us mention the choice between the FIFO (first-in-first-\nout) and LIFO (last-in-first-out) methods of valuing inventories.*\n*Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting fac-\ntors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as if” finan-\ncial statements, which report a company’s earnings as if Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another is the dilu-\ntive effect of issuing millions of stock options for executive compensation,\nthen buying back millions of shares to keep those options from reducing the\nvalue of the common stock. A third is unrealistic assumptions of return on\nthe company’s pension funds, which can artificially inflate earnings in good\nyears and depress them in bad. Another is “Special Purpose Entities,” or\naffiliated firms or partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the com-\nwww.fx1618.comThings to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 317\nAn obvious remark here would be that investors should not pay\nany attention to these accounting variables if the amounts involved\nare relatively small. But Wall Street being as it is, even items quite\nminor in themselves can be taken seriously. Two days before the\nALCOAreport appeared in the Wall Street Journal, the paper had\nquite a discussion of the corresponding statement of Dow Chemi-\ncal. It closed with the observation that “many analysts” had been\ntroubled by the fact that Dow had included a 21-cent item in regu-\nlar profits for 1969, instead of treating it as an item of “extraordi-\nnary income.” Why the fuss? Because, evidently, evaluations of\nDow Chemical involving many millions of dollars in the aggregate\nseemed to depend on exactly what was the percentage gain for\n1969 over 1968—in this case either 9% or 41⁄%. This strikes us\n2\nas rather absurd; it is very unlikely that small differences involved\nin one year’s results could have any bearing on future average\nprofits or growth, and on a conservative, realistic valuation of the\nenterprise.\nBy contrast, consider another statement also appearing in Janu-\nary 1971. This concerned Northwest Industries Inc.’s report for\n1970.* The company was planning to write off, as a special charge,\nnot less than $264 million in one fell swoop. Of this, $200 million\nrepresents the loss to be taken on the proposed sale of the railroad\nsubsidiary to its employees and the balance a write-down of a\nrecent stock purchase. These sums would work out to a loss of\nabout $35 per share of common before dilution offsets, or twice its\nthen current market price. Here we have something really signifi-\npany and thus “remove” those financial risks from the company’s balance\nsheet. Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other\n“soft” costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of\ndoing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary\nthat accompanies this chapter.\n*Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other busi-\nnesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear\n(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over in\n1985 by overindebted financier William Farley, who ran the company into\nthe ground. Fruit of the Loom was bought in a bankruptcy proceeding by\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.\nwww.fx1618.com318 The Intelligent Investor\ncant. If the transaction goes through, and if the tax laws are not\nchanged, this loss provided for in 1970 will permit Northwest\nIndustries to realize about $400 million of future profits (within\nfive years) from its other diversified interests without paying\nincome tax thereon.* What will then be the real earnings of that\nenterprise; should they be calculated with or without provision for\nthe nearly 50% in income taxes which it will not actually have to\npay? In our opinion, the proper mode of calculation would be first\nto consider the indicated earning power on the basis of full income-\ntax liability, and to derive some broad idea of the stock’s value\nbased on that estimate. To this should be added some bonus figure,\nrepresenting the value per share of the important but temporary\ntax exemption the company will enjoy. (Allowance must be made,\nalso, for a possible large-scale dilution in this case. Actually, the\nconvertible preferred issues and warrants would more than double\nthe outstanding common shares if the privileges are exercised.)\nAll this may be confusing and wearisome to our readers, but it\nbelongs in our story. Corporate accounting is often tricky; security\nanalysis can be complicated; stock valuations are really depend-\nable only in exceptional cases.† For most investors it would be\nprobably best to assure themselves that they are getting good value\nfor the prices they pay, and let it go at that.\n*Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that allows corpora-\ntions to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As the tax code now\nstands, these losses can be carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing the\ncompany’s tax liability for the entire period (and thus raising its earnings\nafter tax). Therefore, investors should consider whether recent severe\nlosses could actually improvethe company’s net earnings in the future.\n†Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of\nthem frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in exceptional\ncases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately right most of the\ntime, the price of a stock and the value of its business are almost never iden-\ntical. The market’s judgment on price is often unreliable. Unfortunately, the\nmargin of the market’s pricing errors is often not wide enough to justify the\nexpense of trading on them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate\nthe costs of trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any\nprice discrepancy—and should never count on being able to sell for the\nexact pricwe wcuwrre.nftxly 1qu6o1te8d .inc tohem market.Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 319\nUse of Average Earnings\nIn former times analysts and investors paid considerable atten-\ntion to the average earnings over a fairly long period in the past—\nusually from seven to ten years. This “mean figure”* was useful for\nironing out the frequent ups and downs of the business cycle, and\nit was thought to give a better idea of the company’s earning\npower than the results of the latest year alone. One important\nadvantage of such an averaging process is that it will solve the\nproblem of what to do about nearly all the special charges and\ncredits. They should be included in the average earnings. For cer-\ntainly most of these losses and gains represent a part of the\ncompany’s operating history. If we do this for ALCOA, the average\nearnings for 1961–1970 (ten years) would appear as $3.62 and for\nthe seven years 1964–1970 as $4.62 per share. If such figures are\nused in conjunction with ratings for growth and stability of earn-\nings during the same period, they could give a really informing\npicture of the company’s past performance.\nCalculation of the Past Growth Rate\nIt is of prime importance that the growth factor in a company’s\nrecord be taken adequately into account. Where the growth has\nbeen large the recent earnings will be well above the seven- or ten-\nyear average, and analysts may deem these long-term figures irrel-\nevant. This need not be the case. The earnings can be given in\ntermsbothof the average and the latest figure. We suggest that the\ngrowth rate itself be calculated by comparing the averageof the last\nthree years with corresponding figures ten years earlier. (Where\nthere is a problem of “special charges or credits” it may be dealt\nwith on some compromise basis.) Note the following calculation\nfor the growth of ALCOAas against that of Sears Roebuck and the\nDJIAgroup as a whole.\nComment:These few figures could be made the subject of a long\ndiscussion. They probably show as well as any others, derived by\nelaborate mathematical treatment, the actual growth of earnings\n*“Mean figure” refers to the simple, or arithmetic, average that Graham\ndescwribews win .thfex p1re6c1ed8in.gc soemntence.320 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 12-1\nALCOA Sears Roebuck DJIA\nAverage earnings 1968–1970 $4.95a $2.87 $55.40\nAverage earnings 1958–1960 2.08 1.23 31.49\nGrowth 141.0% 134.0% 75.0%\nAnnual rate (compounded) 9.0% 8.7% 5.7%\naThree-fifths of special charges of 82 cents in 1970 deducted here.\nfor the long period 1958–1970. But how relevant is this figure, gen-\nerally considered central in common-stock valuations, to the case\nof ALCOA? Its past growth rate was excellent, actually a bit better\nthan that of acclaimed Sears Roebuck and much higher than that of\nthe DJIAcomposite. But the market price at the beginning of 1971\nseemed to pay no attention to this fine performance. ALCOAsold\nat only 111⁄ times the recent three-year average, while Sears sold at\n2\n27 times and the DJIAitself at 15+ times. How did this come about?\nEvidently Wall Street has fairly pessimistic views about the future\ncourse of ALCOA’s earnings, in contrast with its past record. Sur-\nprisingly enough, the high price for ALCOAwas made as far back\nas 1959. In that year it sold at 116, or 45 times its earnings. (This\ncompares with a 1959 adjusted high price of 251⁄ for Sears Roebuck,\n2\nor 20 times its then earnings.) Even though ALCOA’s profits did\nshow excellent growth thereafter, it is evident that in this case the\nfuture possibilities were greatly overestimated in the market price.\nIt closed 1970 at exactly half of the 1959 high, while Sears tripled in\nprice and the DJIAmoved up nearly 30%.\nIt should be pointed out that ALCOA’s earnings on capital\nfunds* had been only average or less, and this may be the decisive\nfactor here. High multipliers have been maintainedin the stock mar-\nket only if the company has maintained better than average prof-\nitability.\n*Graham appears to be using “earnings on capital funds” in the traditional\nsense of return on book value—essentially, net income divided by the\ncompanyw’s wtanwgib.flex n1e6t a1ss8e.tsc.omThings to Consider About Per-Share Earnings 321\nLet us apply at this point to ALCOAthe suggestion we made in\nthe previous chapter for a “two-part appraisal process.”* Such an\napproach might have produced a “past-performance value” for\nALCOAof 10% of the DJIA, or $84 per share relative to the closing\nprice of 840 for the DJIA in 1970. On this basis the shares would\nhave appeared quite attractive at their price of 571⁄.\n4\nTowhat extent should the senior analyst have marked down the\n“past-performance value” to allow for adverse developments that\nhe saw in the future? Frankly, we have no idea. Assume he had rea-\nson to believe that the 1971 earnings would be as low as $2.50 per\nshare—a large drop from the 1970 figure, as against an advance\nexpected for the DJIA. Very likely the stock market would take this\npoor performance quite seriously, but would it really establish the\nonce mighty Aluminum Company of America as a relatively\nunprofitable enterprise, to be valued at less than its tangible assets\nbehind the shares?† (In 1971 the price declined from a high of 70 in\nMay to a low of 36 in December, against a book value of 55.)\nALCOA is surely a representative industrial company of huge\nsize, but we think that its price-and-earnings history is more\nunusual, even contradictory, than that of most other large enter-\nprises. Yet this instance supports to some degree, the doubts we\nexpressed in the last chapter as to the dependability of the appraisal\nprocedure when applied to the typical industrial company.\n*See pp. 299–301.\n†Recent history—and a mountain of financial research—have shown that the\nmarket is unkindest to rapidly growing companies that suddenly report a fall\nin earnings. More moderate and stable growers, as ALCOA was in\nGraham’s day or Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive are in our time,\ntend to suffer somewhat milder stock declines if they report disappointing\nearnings. Great expectations lead to great disappointment if they are not\nmet; a failure to meet moderate expectations leads to a much milder reac-\ntion. Thus, one of the biggest risks in owning growth stocks is not that their\ngrowth will stop, but merely that it will slow down.

Compensated heavily through stock options, top execu-\ntives realized that they could become fabulously rich merely by\nincreasing their company’s earnings for just a few years running.1Hun-\ndreds of companies violated the spirit, if not the letter, of accounting\nprinciples—turning their financial reports into gibberish, tarting up ugly\nresults with cosmetic fixes, cloaking expenses, or manufacturing earn-\nings out of thin air. Let’s look at some of these unsavory practices.\nAS IF!\nPerhaps the most widespread bit of accounting hocus-pocus was the\n“pro forma” earnings fad. There’s an old saying on Wall Street that\nevery bad idea starts out as a good idea, and pro forma earnings pre-\nsentation is no different. The original point was to provide a truer pic-\nture of the long-term growth of earnings by adjusting for short-term\ndeviations from the trend or for supposedly “nonrecurring” events. A\npro forma press release might, for instance, show what a company\nwould have earned over the past year if another firm it just acquired\nhad been part of the family for the entire 12 months.\n1For more on how stock options can enrich corporate managers—but not\nnecessarwily wouwtsi.dfex s1ha6re1h8old.ceros—msee the commentary on Chapter 19.\n322Commentary on Chapter 12 323\nBut, as the Naughty 1990s advanced, companies just couldn’t\nleave well enough alone. Just look at these examples of pro forma flim-\nflam:\n• For the quarter ended September 30, 1999, InfoSpace, Inc. pre-\nsented its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid $159.9 million\nin preferred-stock dividends.\n• For the quarter ended October 31, 2001, BEA Systems, Inc. pre-\nsented its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid $193 million in\npayroll taxes on stock options exercised by its employees.\n• For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, JDS Uniphase Corp. pre-\nsented its pro forma earnings as if it had not paid $4 million in\npayroll taxes, had not lost $7 million investing in lousy stocks, and\nhad not incurred $2.5 billion in charges related to mergers and\ngoodwill.\nIn short, pro forma earnings enable companies to show how well\nthey might have done if they hadn’t done as badly as they did.2As an\nintelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro forma earn-\nings is ignore them.\nHUNGRY FOR RECOGNITION\nIn 2000, Qwest Communications International Inc., the telecommuni-\ncations giant, looked strong. Its shares dropped less than 5% even as\nthe stock market lost more than 9% that year.\nBut Qwest’s financial reports held an odd little revelation. In late\n1999, Qwest decided to recognize the revenues from its telephone\ndirectories as soon as the phone books were published—even though,\nas anyone who has ever taken out a Yellow Pages advertisement\nknows, many businesses pay for those ads in monthly installments.\n2All the above examples are taken directly from press releases issued by\nthe companies themselves. For a brilliant satire on what daily life would be\nlike if we all got to justify our behavior the same way companies adjust their\nreported earnings, see “My Pro Forma Life,” by Rob Walker, at http://slate.\nmsn.com/?id=2063953.

That piddly-sounding “change in accounting principle”\npumped up 1999 net income by $240 million after taxes—a fifth of all\nthe money Qwest earned that year.\nLike a little chunk of ice crowning a submerged iceberg, aggressive\nrevenue recognition is often a sign of dangers that run deep and loom\nlarge—and so it was at Qwest. By early 2003, after reviewing its previ-\nous financial statements, the company announced that it had prema-\nturely recognized profits on equipment sales, improperly recorded the\ncosts of services provided by outsiders, inappropriately booked costs\nas if they were capital assets rather than expenses, and unjustifiably\ntreated the exchange of assets as if they were outright sales. All told,\nQwest’s revenues for 2000 and 2001 had been overstated by $2.2\nbillion—including $80 million from the earlier “change in accounting\nprinciple,” which was now reversed.3\nCAPITAL OFFENSES\nIn the late 1990s, Global Crossing Ltd. had unlimited ambitions. The\nBermuda-based company was building what it called the “first inte-\ngrated global fiber optic network” over more than 100,000 miles of\n3In 2002, Qwest was one of 330 publicly-traded companies to restate past\nfinancial statements, an all-time record, according to Huron Consulting\nGroup.

No hindsight\nwas required to detect the “change in accounting principle,” which Qwest\nfully disclosed at the time. How did Qwest’s shares do over this period? At\nyear-end 2000, the stock had been at $41 per share, a total market value of\n$67.9 billion. By early 2003, Qwest was around $4, valuing the entire com-\npany at less than $7 billion—a 90% loss. The drop in share price is not the\nonly cost associated with bogus earnings; a recent study found that a sam-\nple of 27 firms accused of accounting fraud by the SEC had overpaid $320\nmillion in Federal income tax. Although much of that money will eventually be\nrefunded by the IRS, most shareholders are unlikely to stick around to bene-\nfit from the refunds.

After wiring\nthe world, Global Crossing would sell other communications compa-\nnies the right to carry their traffic over its network of cables. In 1998\nalone, Global Crossing spent more than $600 million to construct its\noptical web. That year, nearly a third of the construction budget was\ncharged against revenues as an expense called “cost of capacity\nsold.” If not for that $178 million expense, Global Crossing—which\nreported a net loss of $96 million—could have reported a net profit of\nroughly $82 million.\nThe next year, says a bland footnote in the 1999 annual report,\nGlobal Crossing “initiated service contract accounting.” The company\nwould no longer charge most construction costs as expenses against\nthe immediate revenues it received from selling capacity on its net-\nwork.

But Global Crossing did not book most of the revenues up front,\ninstead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease. Now, however, because\nthe networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25 years, Global Cross-\ning began treating them as depreciable, long-lived capital assets.

But that gain didn’t come only from\nSBC’s business. Fully $1.4 billion of it—13% of the company’s net\nincome—came from SBC’s pension plan.\nBecause SBC had more money in the pension plan than it esti-\nmated was necessary to pay its employees’ future benefits, the com-\npany got to treat the difference as current income. One simple reason\nfor that surplus: In 2001, SBC raised the rate of return it expected to\nearn on the pension plan’s investments from 8.5% to 9.5%—lowering\nthe amount of money it needed to set aside today.\nSBC explained its rosy new expectations by noting that “for each\nof the three years ended 2001, our actual 10-year return on invest-\nments exceeded 10%.” In other words, our past returns have been\nhigh, so let’s assume that our future returns will be too. But that not\nonly flunked the most rudimentary tests of logic, it flew in the face of\nthe fact that interest rates were falling to near-record lows, depressing\nthe future returns on the bond portion of a pension portfolio.\nThe same year, in fact, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway low-\nered the expected rate of return on its pension assets from 8.3% to\n6.5%. Was SBC being realistic in assuming that its pension-fund man-\nagers could significantly outperform the world’s greatest investor?\nProbably not: In 2001, Berkshire Hathaway’s pension fund gained\n9.8%, but SBC’s pension fund lost 6.9%.6\n5I am grateful to Howard Schilit and Mark Hamel of the Center for Financial\nResearch and Analysis for providing this example.\n6Returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan assets at\nthe bwegwinnwing. foxf 1th6e y1e8ar .bcyo “amctual return on plan assets.”328 Commentary on Chapter 12\nHere are some quick considerations for the intelligent investor: Is\nthe “net pension benefit” more than 5% of the company’s net income?\n(If so, would you still be comfortable with the company’s other earn-\nings if those pension gains went away in future years?)

Never buy a stock without reading the footnotes\nto the financial statements in the annual report.

They are designed expressly to deter normal people from actually\nreading them—which is why you must persevere.

However, for certain com-\nputer hardware manufacturers and end-user licensees with amounts\npayable within twelve months, the Company will recognize revenue at the\ntime the customer makes a contractual commitment for a minimum non-\nrefundable license fee, if such computer hardware manufacturers and end-\nuser licensees meet certain criteria established by the Company.” In plain\nEnglish, Informix was saying that it would credit itself for revenues on prod-\nucts even if they had not yet been resold to “end-users” (the actual cus-\ntomers for Informix’s software).

We have selected, more or less at random,\nfour companies which are found successively on the New York\nStock Exchange list. These are eltra Corp. (a merger of Electric\nAutolite and Mergenthaler Linotype enterprises), Emerson Electric\nCo. (a manufacturer of electric and electronic products), Emery Air\nFreight (a domestic forwarder of air freight), and Emhart Corp.\n(originally a maker of bottling machinery only, but now also in\nbuilders’ hardware).* There are some broad resemblances between\nthe three manufacturing firms, but the differences will seem more\nsignificant. There should be sufficient variety in the financial and\noperating data to make the examination of interest.\nIn Table 13-1 we present a summary of what the four companies\nwere selling for in the market at the end of 1970, and a few figures\non their 1970 operations. We then detail certain key ratios, which\nrelate on the one hand to performance and on the other to price.\nComment is called for on how various aspects of the performance\npattern agree with the relative price pattern. Finally, we shall pass\nthe four companies in review, suggesting some comparisons and\nrelationships and evaluating each in terms of the requirements of a\nconservative common-stock investor.\n*Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in the same\nform. ELTRA Corp. is no longer an independent company; it merged with\nBunker Ramo Corp. in the 1970s, putting it in the business of supplying\nstock quotes to brokerage firms across an early network of computers.\nWhat remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell Corp. The firm\nformerly known as Emery Air Freight is now a division of CNF Inc. Emhart\nCorp. was acquired by Black & Decker Corp. in 1989.\nwww.fx1618.com\n330seinapmoC\ndetsiL\nruoF\nfo\nnosirapmoCA\n1-31ELBAT\n.proC\ntrahmE\nthgierF\nriA\nyremE\ncirtcelE\nnosremE\nARTLE\nnoitazilatipaC\n.A\n⁄323\n⁄375\n66\n72\n0791\n,13\n.ceD\n,nommoc\nfo\necirP\n4\n4\n000,239,4\n000,708,3\na000,488,42\n000,417,7\nnommoc\nfo\nserahs\nfo\nrebmuN\n000,000,061$\n000,000,022$\n000,000,046,1$\n000,003,802$\nnommoc\nfo\neulav\ntekraM\n000,002,9\n000,000,24\n000,000,8\nkcots\nderreferp\ndna\nsdnoB\n000,002,961\n000,000,022\n000,000,286,1\n000,003,612\nnoitazilatipac\nlatoT\nsmetI\nemocnI\n.B\n000,000,722$\n000,000,801$\n000,000,756$\n000,000,454$\n0791\n,selaS\n000,155,31\n000,976,5\n000,006,45\n000,377,02\n0791\n,emocni\nteN\nb57.2$\n94.1$\n03.2$\n07.2$\n0791\n,erahs\nrep\ndenraE\n18.2\n82.1\n01.2\n87.2\n0791–8691\n,.eva\n,erahs\nrep\ndenraE\n64.2\n45.\n60.1\n45.1\n5691–3691\n,.eva\n,erahs\nrep\ndenraE\n12.1\n71.\n75.\n45.\n0691–8591\n,.eva\n,erahs\nrep\ndenraE\n02.1\n00.1\n61.1\n02.1\ndnedivid\ntnerruC\n0791\n,smetI\nteehs-ecnalaB\n.C\n000,000,121$\n000,004,02$\n000,000,703$\n000,000,502$\nstessa\ntnerruC\n000,008,43\n000,008,11\n000,000,27\n000,000,17\nseitilibail\ntnerruC\n000,000,331\n000,002,51\n000,000,752\n000,000,702\nkcots\nnommoc\nrof\nstessa\nteN\n20.72$\n69.3$\n43.01$\n50.72$\nerahs\nrep\neulav\nkooB\n.kcots\nderreferp\nfo\nnoisrevnoc\ngnimussAa\n.erahs\nrep\nstnec\n31\nfo\negrahc\nlaiceps\nretfAb\n.0791\n.tpeS\ndedne\nraeYc\nwww.fx1618.com332 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 13-2 AComparison of Four Listed\nCompanies (continued)\nEmerson Emery Emhart\nELTRA Electric Air Freight Corp.\nB.

Two of the enter-\nprises—eltra and Emhart—were modestly priced at only 9.7\ntimes and 12 times the average earnings for 1968–1970, as against a\nsimilar figure of 15.5 times for the DJIA. The other two—Emerson\nand Emery—showed very high multiples of 33 and 45 times such\nearnings. There is bound to be some explanation of a difference\nsuch as this, and it is found in the superior growth of the favored\ncompanies’ profits in recent years, especially by the freight for-\nwarder. (But the growth figures of the other two firms were not\nunsatisfactory.)\nFor more comprehensive treatment let us review briefly the\nchief elements of performance as they appear from our figures.\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Four Listed Companies 333\n1. Profitability. (a) All the companies show satisfactory earnings\non their book value, but the figures for Emerson and Emery are\nmuch higher than for the other two. A high rate of return on\ninvested capital often goes along with a high annual growth rate in\nearnings per share.* All the companies except Emery showed bet-\nter earnings on book value in 1969 than in 1961; but the Emery fig-\nure was exceptionally large in both years. (b) For manufacturing\ncompanies, the profit figure per dollar of sales is usually an indica-\ntion of comparative strength or weakness. We use here the “ratio of\noperating income to sales,” as given in Standard & Poor’s Listed\nStock Reports. Here again the results are satisfactory for all four\ncompanies, with an especially impressive showing by Emerson.\nThe changes between 1961 and 1969 vary considerably among the\ncompanies.\n2. Stability. This we measure by the maximum decline in per-\nshare earnings in any one of the past ten years, as against the aver-\nage of the three preceding years. No decline translates into 100%\nstability, and this was registered by the two popular concerns. But\nthe shrinkages of eltra and Emhart were quite moderate in the\n“poor year” 1970, amounting to only 8% each by our measurement,\nagainst 7% for the DJIA.\n3. Growth. The two low-multiplier companies show quite satis-\nfactory growth rates, in both cases doing better than the Dow Jones\ngroup. The eltra figures are especially impressive when set\nagainst its low price/earnings ratio. The growth is of course more\nimpressive for the high-multiplier pair.\n4. Financial Position. The three manufacturing companies are in\nsound financial condition, having better than the standard ratio of\n$2 of current assets for $1 of current liabilities. Emery Air Freight\nhas a lower ratio; but it falls in a different category, and with its fine\nrecord it would have no problem raising needed cash. All the com-\npanies have relatively low long-term debt. “Dilution” note: Emer-\nson Electric had $163 million of market value of low-dividend\n*This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value” in Table\n13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage of their\ntangible book value.\nwww.fx1618.com334 The Intelligent Investor\nconvertible preferred shares outstanding at the end of 1970. In\nour analysis we have made allowance for the dilution factor in\nthe usual way by treating the preferred as if converted into com-\nmon. This decreased recent earnings by about 10 cents per share, or\nsome 4%.\n5. Dividends. What really counts is the history of continuance\nwithout interruption. The best record here is Emhart’s, which has\nnot suspended a payment since 1902. eltra’srecord is very good,\nEmerson’s quite satisfactory, Emery Freight is a newcomer. The\nvariations in payout percentage do not seem especially significant.\nThe current dividend yield is twice as high on the “cheap pair” as\non the “dear pair,” corresponding to the price/earnings ratios.\n6.Price History.The reader should be impressed by the percent-\nage advance shown in the price of all four of these issues, as mea-\nsured from the lowest to the highest points during the past 34\nyears. (In all cases the low price has been adjusted for subsequent\nstock splits.) Note that for the DJIAthe range from low to high was\non the order of 11 to 1; for our companies the spread has varied\nfrom “only” 17 to 1 for Emhart to no less than 528 to 1 for Emery\nAir Freight.* These manifold price advances are characteristic of\nmost of our older common-stock issues, and they proclaim the\ngreat opportunities of profit that have existed in the stock markets\nof the past. (But they may indicate also how overdone were the\ndeclines in the bear markets before 1950 when the low prices were\nregistered.) Both eltra and Emhart sustained price shrinkages of\nmore than 50% in the 1969–70 price break. Emerson and Emery had\nserious, but less distressing, declines; the former rebounded to a\nnew all-time high before the end of 1970, the latter in early 1971.\n*In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and dividing\nthe high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price. For example,\nEmery’s high price of 66 divided by its low price of 1/8 equals 528, or a\nratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Four Listed Companies 335\nGeneral Observations on the Four Companies\nEmerson Electric has an enormous total market value, dwarfing\nthe other three companies combined.* It is one of our “good-will\ngiants,” to be commented on later. Afinancial analyst blessed (or\nhandicapped) with a good memory will think of an analogy\nbetween Emerson Electric and Zenith Radio, and that would not be\nreassuring. For Zenith had a brilliant growth record for many\nyears; it too sold in the market for $1.7 billion (in 1966); but its prof-\nits fell from $43 million in 1968 to only half as much in 1970, and in\nthat year’s big selloff its price declined to 221⁄ against the previous\n2\ntop of 89. High valuations entail high risks.\nEmery Air Freightmust be the most promising of the four compa-\nnies in terms of future growth, if the price/earnings ratio of nearly 40\ntimes its highest reported earnings is to be even partially justified.\nThe past growth, of course, has been most impressive. But these fig-\nures may not be so significant for the future if we consider that they\nstarted quite small, at only $570,000 of net earnings in 1958. It often\nproves much more difficult to continue to grow at a high rate after\nvolume and profits have already expanded to big totals. The most\nsurprising aspect of Emery’s story is that its earnings and market\nprice continued to grow apace in 1970, which was the worst year in\nthe domestic air-passenger industry. This is a remarkable achieve-\nment indeed, but it raises the question whether future profits may\nnot be vulnerable to adverse developments, through increased com-\npetition, pressure for new arrangements between forwarders and air-\nlines, etc. An elaborate study might be needed before a sound\njudgment could be passed on these points, but the conservative\ninvestor cannot leave them out of his general reckoning.\nEmhartandeltra. Emhart has done better in its business than in\nthe stock market over the past 14 years. In 1958 it sold as high as 22\ntimes the current earnings—about the same ratio as for the DJIA.\nSince then its profits tripled, as against a rise of less than 100% for\nthe Dow, but its closing price in 1970 was only a third above the\n*At the end of 1970, Emerson’s $1.6 billion in market value truly was “enor-\nmous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002, Emerson’s\ncommon stock had a total market value of approximately $21 billion.\nwww.fx1618.com336 The Intelligent Investor\n1958 high, versus 43% for the Dow. The record of eltra is some-\nwhat similar. It appears that neither of these companies possesses\nglamour, or “sex appeal,” in the present market; but in all the sta-\ntistical data they show up surprisingly well. Their future pros-\npects? We have no sage remarks to make here, but this is what\nStandard & Poor’s had to say about the four companies in 1971:\neltra—“Long-term Prospects: Certain operations are cyclical, but an\nestablished competitive position and diversification are offsetting fac-\ntors.”\nEmerson Electric—“While adequately priced (at 71) on the current\noutlook, the shares have appeal for the long term....Acontinued acqui-\nsition policy together with a strong position in industrial fields and an\naccelerated international program suggests further sales and earnings\nprogress.”\nEmery Air Freight—“The shares appear amply priced (at 57) on cur-\nrent prospects, but are well worth holding for the long pull.”\nEmhart—“Although restricted this year by lower capital spending in\nthe glass-container industry, earnings should be aided by an improved\nbusiness environment in 1972. The shares are worth holding (at 34).”\nConclusions: Many financial analysts will find Emerson and\nEmery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two—\nprimarily, perhaps, because of their better “market action,” and\nsecondarily because of their faster recent growth in earnings.\nUnder our principles of conservative investment the first is not a\nvalid reason for selection—that is something for the speculators to\nplay around with. The second has validity, but within limits. Can\nthe past growth and the presumably good prospects of Emery Air\nFreight justify a price more than 60 times its recent earnings?1Our\nanswer would be: Maybe for someone who has made an in-depth\nstudy of the possibilities of this company and come up with excep-\ntionally firm and optimistic conclusions. But not for the careful\ninvestor who wants to be reasonably sure in advance that he is not\ncommitting the typical Wall Street error of overenthusiasm for\ngood performance in earnings and in the stock market.* The same\n*Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most fashionable\nand highwly wvawlue.df xin1 1691728, .Ecmoermy fared among the worst. The March 1,AComparison of Four Listed Companies 337\ncautionary statements seem called for in the case of Emerson Elec-\ntric, with a special reference to the market’s current valuation of\nover a billion dollars for the intangible, or earning-power, factor\nhere. We should add that the “electronics industry,” once a fair-\nhaired child of the stock market, has in general fallen on disastrous\ndays. Emerson is an outstanding exception, but it will have to con-\ntinue to be such an exception for a great many years in the future\nbefore the 1970 closing price will have been fully justified by its\nsubsequent performance.\nBy contrast, both eltra at 27 and Emhart at 33 have the ear-\nmarks of companies with sufficient value behind their price to con-\nstitute reasonably protected investments. Here the investor can, if\nhe wishes, consider himself basically a part owner of these busi-\nnesses, at a cost corresponding to what the balance sheet shows to\nbe the money invested therein.* The rate of earnings on invested\ncapital has long been satisfactory; the stability of profits also; the\npast growth rate surprisingly so. The two companies will meet our\nsevenstatisticalrequirements for inclusion in a defensive investor’s\nportfolio. These will be developed in the next chapter, but we sum-\nmarize them as follows:\n1. Adequate size.\n2. Asufficiently strong financial condition.\n3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years.\n4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years.\n1982, issue of Forbesreported that since 1972 Emery had lost 72.8% of its\nvalue after inflation. By late 1974, according to the investment researchers\nat the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s stock had already fallen 58%\nand its price/earnings ratio had plummeted from 64 times to just 15. The\n“overenthusiasm” Graham had warned against was eviscerated in short\norder. Can the passage of time make up for this kind of excess? Not always:\nLeuthold calculated that $1000 invested in Emery in 1972 would be worth\nonly $839 as of 1999. It’s likely that the people who overpaid for Internet\nstocks in the late 1990s will not break even for decades—if ever (see the\ncommentary on Chapter 20).\n*Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an investor could\nbuy shares in these two companies for little more than their book value, as\nshowwn iwn twhe .tfhxird1 l6ine1 o8f .Sceoctmion B in Table 13-2.338 The Intelligent Investor\n5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings.\n6. Price of stock no more than 11⁄ times net asset value.\n2\n7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three\nyears.\nWemake no predictions about the future earnings performance\nof eltra or Emhart. In the investor’s diversified list of common\nstocks there are bound to be some that prove disappointing, and\nthis may be the case for one or both of this pair. But the diversified\nlist itself, based on the above principles of selection, plus whatever\nother sensible criteria the investor may wish to apply, should per-\nform well enough across the years. At least, long experience tells\nus so.\nAfinal observation: An experienced security analyst, even if he\naccepted our general reasoning on these four companies, would\nhave hesitated to recommend that a holder of Emerson or Emery\nexchangehis shares for eltraor Emhart at the end of 1970—unless\nthe holder understood clearly the philosophy behind the recom-\nmendation. There was no reason to expect that in any short period\nof time the low-multiplier duo would outperform the high-\nmultipliers. The latter were well thought of in the market and thus\nhad a considerable degree of momentum behind them, which\nmight continue for an indefinite period. The sound basis for prefer-\nring eltra and Emhart to Emerson and Emery would be the\nclient’s considered conclusion that he preferred value-type invest-\nments to glamour-type investments. Thus, to a substantial extent,\ncommon-stock investment policy must depend on the attitude of\nthe individual investor. This approach is treated at greater length\nin our next chapter.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 13\nIn the Air Force we have a rule: check six.

With its base in Old Econ-\nomy industries, Emerson looked boring in the late 1990s. (In the Inter-\nnet Age, who cared about Emerson’s heavy-duty wet-dry vacuums?)\nThe company’s shares went into suspended animation. In 1998 and\n1999, Emerson’s stock lagged the S & P 500 index by a cumulative\n49.7 percentage points, a miserable underperformance.\nBut that was Emerson the stock. What about Emerson the com-\npany? In 1999, Emerson sold $14.4 billion worth of goods and ser-\nvices, up nearly $1 billion from the year before. On those revenues\nEmerson earned $1.3 billion in net income, or 6.9% more than in\n1998. Over the previous five years, earnings per share had risen at a\nrobust average rate of 8.3%. Emerson’s dividend had more than dou-\nbled to $1.30 per share; book value had gone from $6.69 to $14.27\nper share. According to Value Line, throughout the 1990s, Emerson’s\nnet profit margin and return on capital—key measures of its efficiency\nas a business—had stayed robustly high, around 9% and 18% respec-\ntively. What’s more, Emerson had increased its earnings for 42 years\nin a row and had raised its dividend for 43 straight years—one of the\nlongest runs of steady growth in American business. At year-end,\nEmerson’s stock was priced at 17.7 times the company’s net income\nper share. Like its power tools, Emerson was never flashy, but it was\nreliable—and showed no sign of overheating.\nCOULD EMC GROW PDQ?\nEMC Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s,\nrising—or should we say levitating?—more than 81,000%. If you had\ninvested $10,000 in EMC’s stock at the beginning of 1990, you\nwould have ended 1999 with just over $8.1 million. EMC’s shares\nreturned 157.1% in 1999 alone—more than Emerson’s stock had\ngained in the eight years from 1992 through 1999 combined. EMC\nhad never paid a dividend, instead retaining all its earnings “to provide\nfunds for the continued growth of the company.”1 At their December\n1As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in practice, “to pro-\nvide funds for the continued growth of the company’s top managers’ wealth.”\nwww.fx1618.com342 Commentary on Chapter 13\n31 price of $54.625, EMC’s shares were trading at 103 times the\nearnings the company would report for the full year—nearly six times\nthe valuation level of Emerson’s stock.\nWhat about EMC the business? Revenues grew 24% in 1999, ris-\ning to $6.7 billion. Its earnings per share soared to 92 cents from 61\ncents the year before, a 51% increase. Over the five years ending in\n1999, EMC’s earnings had risen at a sizzling annual rate of 28.8%.\nAnd, with everyone expecting the tidal wave of Internet commerce to\nkeep rolling, the future looked even brighter. Throughout 1999, EMC’s\nchief executive repeatedly predicted that revenues would hit $10 bil-\nlion by 2001—up from $5.4 billion in 1998.2 That would require aver-\nage annual growth of 23%, a monstrous rate of expansion for so big a\ncompany. But Wall Street’s analysts, and most investors, were sure\nEMC could do it. After all, over the previous five years, EMC had more\nthan doubled its revenues and better than tripled its net income.\nBut from 1995 through 1999, according to Value Line, EMC’s net\nprofit margin slid from 19.0% to 17.4%, while its return on capital\ndropped from 26.8% to 21%. Although still highly profitable, EMC\nwas already slipping. And in October 1999, EMC acquired Data Gen-\neral Corp., which added roughly $1.1 billion to EMC’s revenues that\nyear. Simply by subtracting the extra revenues brought in from Data\nGeneral, we can see that the volume of EMC’s existing businesses\ngrew from $5.4 billion in 1998 to just $5.6 billion in 1999, a rise of\nonly 3.6%. In other words, EMC’s true growth rate was almost nil—\neven in a year when the scare over the “Y2K” computer bug had led\nmany companies to spend record amounts on new technology.3\n2Appearing on CNBC on December 30, 1999, EMC’s chief executive,\nMichael Ruettgers, was asked by host Ron Insana whether “2000 and\nbeyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like it’s\naccelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock was\novervalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the opportunity\nwe have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited....So while it’s hard to predict\nwhether these things are overpriced, there’s such a major change taking\nplace that if you could find the winners today—and I certainly think EMC is\none of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in the future.”\n3The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that millions of\ncomputers worldwide would stop functioning at one second past midnight\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 13 343\nA SIMPLE TWIST OF FREIGHT\nUnlike EMC, Expeditors International hadn’t yet learned to levitate.\nAlthough the firm’s shares had risen 30% annually in the 1990s, much\nof that big gain had come at the very end, as the stock raced to a\n109.1% return in 1999. The year before, Expeditors’ shares had gone\nup just 9.5%, trailing the S & P 500 index by more than 19 percentage\npoints.\nWhat about the business? Expeditors was growing expeditiously\nindeed: Since 1995, its revenues had risen at an average annual rate\nof 19.8%, nearly tripling over the period to finish 1999 at $1.4 billion.\nAnd earnings per share had grown by 25.8% annually, while dividends\nhad risen at a 27% annual clip. Expeditors had no long-term debt, and\nits working capital had nearly doubled since 1995. According to Value\nLine, Expeditors’ book value per share had increased 129% and its\nreturn on capital had risen by more than one-third to 21%.\nBy any standard, Expeditors was a superb business. But the little\nfreight-forwarding company, with its base in Seattle and much of its\noperations in Asia, was all-but-unknown on Wall Street. Only 32% of\nthe shares were owned by institutional investors; in fact, Expeditors\nhad only 8,500 shareholders. After doubling in 1999, the stock was\npriced at 39 times the net income Expeditors would earn for the year—\nno longer anywhere near cheap, but well below the vertiginous valua-\ntion of EMC.\nTHE PROMISED LAND?\nBy the end of 1999, Exodus Communications seemed to have taken\nits shareholders straight to the land of milk and honey. The stock\nsoared 1,005.8% in 1999—enough to turn a $10,000 investment on\nJanuary 1 into more than $110,000 by December 31. Wall Street’s\nleading Internet-stock analysts, including the hugely influential Henry\non the morning of January 1, 2000, because programmers in the 1960s and\n1970s had not thought to allow for the possibility of any date past\n12/31/1999 in their operating code. U.S. companies spent billions of dol-\nlars in 1999 to ensure that their computers would be “Y2K-compliant.” In the\nend, at 12:00:01 A.M.on January 1, 2000, everything worked just fine.\nwww.fx1618.com344 Commentary on Chapter 13\nBlodget of Merrill Lynch, were predicting that the stock would rise\nanother 25% to 125% over the coming year.\nAnd best of all, in the eyes of the online traders who gorged on\nExodus’s gains, was the fact that the stock had split 2-for-1 three\ntimes during 1999. In a 2-for-1 stock split, a company doubles the\nnumber of its shares and halves their price—so a shareholder ends up\nowning twice as many shares, each priced at half the former level.\nWhat’s so great about that? Imagine that you handed me a dime, and\nI then gave you back two nickels and asked, “Don’t you feel richer\nnow?” You would probably conclude either that I was an idiot, or that I\nhad mistaken you for one. And yet, in 1999’s frenzy over dot-com\nstocks, online traders acted exactly as if two nickels were more valu-\nable than one dime. In fact, just the news that a stock would be split-\nting 2-for-1 could instantly drive its shares up 20% or more.\nWhy? Because getting more shares makes people feel richer.\nSomeone who bought 100 shares of Exodus in January watched them\nturn into 200 when the stock split in April; then those 200 turned into\n400 in August; then the 400 became 800 in December. It was thrilling\nfor these people to realize that they had gotten 700 more shares just\nfor owning 100 in the first place. To them, that felt like “found money”—\nnever mind that the price per share had been cut in half with each\nsplit.4 In December, 1999, one elated Exodus shareholder, who went\nby the handle “givemeadollar,” exulted on an online message board:\n“I’m going to hold these shares until I’m 80, [because] after it splits\nhundreds of times over the next years, I’ll be close to becoming\nCEO.”5\nWhat about Exodus the business? Graham wouldn’t have touched\nit with a 10-foot pole and a haz-mat suit. Exodus’s revenues were\nexploding—growing from $52.7 million in 1998 to $242.1 million in\n1999—but it lost $130.3 million on those revenues in 1999, nearly\ndouble its loss the year before. Exodus had $2.6 billion in total debt—\nand was so starved for cash that it borrowed $971 million in the\n4For more on the folly of stock splits, see Jason Zweig, “Splitsville,” Money,\nMarch, 2001, pp. 55–56.\n5Posting no. 3622, December 7, 1999, at the Exodus Communications\nmessage board on the Raging Bull website (http://ragingbull.lycos.com/\nmboard/boards.cgi?board=EXDS&read=3622).\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 13 345\nmonth of December alone. According to Exodus’s annual report, that\nnew borrowing would add more than $50 million to its interest pay-\nments in the coming year. The company started 1999 with $156 mil-\nlion in cash and, even after raising $1.3 billion in new financing,\nfinished the year with a cash balance of $1 billion—meaning that its\nbusinesses had devoured more than $400 million in cash during\n1999. How could such a company ever pay its debts?\nBut, of course, online traders were fixated on how far and fast the\nstockhad risen, not on whether the companywas healthy. “This stock,”\nbragged a trader using the screen name of “Launch_Pad1999,” “will just\ncontinue climbing to infinity and beyond.”6\nThe absurdity of Launch_Pad’s prediction—what is “beyond” infin-\nity?—is the perfect reminder of one of Graham’s classic warnings.\n“Today’s investor,” Graham tells us,\nis so concerned with anticipating the future that he is already paying\nhandsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has projected with so much\nstudy and care may actually happen and still not bring him any profit. If it\nshould fail to materialize to the degree expected he may in fact be faced\nwith a serious temporary and perhaps even permanent loss.”7\nWHERE THE ES ENDED UP\nHow did these four stocks perform after 1999?\nEmerson Electric went on to gain 40.7% in 2000. Although the\nshares lost money in both 2001 and 2002, they nevertheless ended\n2002 less than 4% below their final price of 1999.\nEMC also rose in 2000, gaining 21.7%. But then the shares lost\n79.4% in 2001 and another 54.3% in 2002. That left them 88%\nbelow their level at year-end 1999. What about the forecast of $10\nbillion in revenues by 2001? EMC finished that year with revenues of\njust $7.1 billion (and a net loss of $508 million).\n6Posting no. 3910, December 15, 1999, at the Exodus Communications\nmessage board on the Raging Bull website (http://ragingbull.lycos.com/\nmboard/boards.cgi?board=EXDS&read=3910).\n7See Graham’s speech, “The New Speculation in Common Stocks,” in the\nAppendix, p. 563.\nwww.fx1618.com346 Commentary on Chapter 13\nMeanwhile, as if the bear market did not even exist, Expeditors\nInternational’s shares went on to gain 22.9% in 2000, 6.5% in 2001,\nand another 15.1% in 2002—finishing that year nearly 51% higher\nthan their price at the end of 1999.\nExodus’s stock lost 55% in 2000 and 99.8% in 2001. On Septem-\nber 26, 2001, Exodus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nMost of the company’s assets were bought by Cable & Wireless, the\nBritish telecommunications giant. Instead of delivering its sharehold-\ners to the promised land, Exodus left them exiled in the wilderness. As\nof early 2003, the last trade in Exodus’s stock was at one penny a\nshare.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 14\nStock Selection for the Defensive Investor\nI\nt is time to turn to some broader applications of the techniques of\nsecurity analysis. Since we have already described in general terms\nthe investment policies recommended for our two categories of\ninvestors,* it would be logical for us now to indicate how security\nanalysis comes into play in order to implement these policies. The\ndefensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only\nhigh-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks.\nHe is to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is\nnot unduly high as judged by applicable standards.\nIn setting up this diversified list he has a choice of two\napproaches, the DJIA-type of portfolio and the quantitatively-\ntested portfolio. In the first he acquires a true cross-section sample\nof the leading issues, which will include both some favored growth\ncompanies, whose shares sell at especially high multipliers, and\nalso less popular and less expensive enterprises. This could be\ndone, most simply perhaps, by buying the same amounts of all\nthirty of the issues in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Ten\nshares of each, at the 900 level for the average, would cost an\naggregate of about $16,000.1 On the basis of the past record he\nmight expect approximately the same future results by buying\nshares of several representative investment funds.†\nHis second choice would be to apply a set of standards to each\n*Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters 4\nthrough 7.\n†As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9, today’s\ndefensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a low-cost index\nfund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total U.S. stock market.\nwww.fx1618.com\n347348 The Intelligent Investor\npurchase, to make sure that he obtains (1) a minimum of qualityin\nthe past performance and current financial position of the com-\npany, and also (2) a minimum of quantityin terms of earnings and\nassets per dollar of price. At the close of the previous chapter we\nlisted seven such quality and quantity criteria suggested for the\nselection of specific common stocks. Let us describe them in order.\n1. Adequate Size of the Enterprise\nAll our minimum figures must be arbitrary and especially in the\nmatter of size required. Our idea is to exclude small companies\nwhich may be subject to more than average vicissitudes especially\nin the industrial field. (There are often good possibilities in such\nenterprises but we do not consider them suited to the needs of the\ndefensive investor.) Let us use round amounts: not less than $100\nmillion of annual sales for an industrial company and, not less than\n$50 million of total assets for a public utility.\n2. ASufficiently Strong Financial Condition\nFor industrial companies current assets should be at least twice\ncurrent liabilities—a so-called two-to-one current ratio. Also, long-\nterm debt should not exceed the net current assets (or “working\ncapital”). For public utilities the debt should not exceed twice the\nstock equity (at book value).\n3. Earnings Stability\nSome earnings for the common stock in each of the past ten\nyears.\n4. Dividend Record\nUninterrupted payments for at least the past 20 years.\n5. Earnings Growth\nAminimum increase of at least one-third in per-share earnings\nin the past ten years using three-year averages at the beginning\nand end.\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the DefensiveInvestor 349\n6. Moderate Price/Earnings Ratio\nCurrent price should not be more than 15 times average earn-\nings of the past three years.\n7. Moderate Ratio of Price to Assets\nCurrent price should not be more than 11⁄ times the book value last\n2\nreported. However, a multiplier of earnings below 15 could justify a\ncorrespondingly higher multiplier of assets. As a rule of thumb we\nsuggest that the product of the multiplier times the ratio of price to\nbook value should not exceed 22.5. (This figure corresponds to 15\ntimes earnings and 11⁄ times book value. It would admit an issue sell-\n2\ning at only 9 times earnings and 2.5 times asset value, etc.)\nGeneral Comments: These requirements are set up especially\nfor the needs and the temperament of defensive investors. They\nwill eliminate the great majority of common stocks as candidates\nfor the portfolio, and in two opposite ways. On the one hand they\nwill exclude companies that are (1) too small, (2) in relatively weak\nfinancial condition, (3) with a deficit stigma in their ten-year\nrecord, and (4) not having a long history of continuous dividends.\nOf these tests the most severe under recent financial conditions are\nthose of financial strength. Aconsiderable number of our large and\nformerly strongly entrenched enterprises have weakened their cur-\nrent ratio or overexpanded their debt, or both, in recent years.\nOur last two criteria are exclusive in the opposite direction, by\ndemanding more earnings and more assets per dollar of price than\nthe popular issues will supply. This is by no means the standard\nviewpoint of financial analysts; in fact most will insist that even\nconservative investors should be prepared to pay generous prices\nfor stocks of the choice companies. We have expounded our con-\ntrary view above; it rests largely on the absence of an adequate fac-\ntor of safety when too large a portion of the price must depend on\never-increasing earnings in the future. The reader will have to\ndecide this important question for himself—after weighing the\narguments on both sides.\nWe have nonetheless opted for the inclusion of a modest\nrequirement of growth over the past decade. Without it the typical\ncompany would show retrogression, at least in terms of profit per\nwww.fx1618.com350 The Intelligent Investor\ndollar of invested capital. There is no reason for the defensive\ninvestor to include such companies—though if the price is low\nenough they could qualify as bargain opportunities.\nThe suggested maximum figure of 15 times earnings might well\nresult in a typical portfolio with an averagemultiplier of, say, 12 to\n13 times. Note that in February 1972 American Tel. & Tel. sold at 11\ntimes its three-year (and current) earnings, and Standard Oil of\nCalifornia at less than 10 times latest earnings. Our basic recom-\nmendation is that the stock portfolio, when acquired, should have\nan overall earnings/price ratio—the reverse of the P/E ratio—at\nleast as high as the current high-grade bond rate. This would mean\na P/E ratio no higher than 13.3 against an AAbond yield of 7.5%.*\nApplication of Our Criteria to the DJIAat the End of 1970\nAll of our suggested criteria were satisfied by the DJIAissues at\nthe end of 1970, but two of them just barely. Here is a survey based\non the closing price of 1970 and the relevant figures. (The basic\ndata for each company are shown in Tables 14-1 and 14-2.)\n1. Size is more than ample for each company.\n2. Financial condition is adequate in the aggregate, but not for\nevery company.2\n3. Some dividend has been paid by every company since at least\n1940. Five of the dividend records go back to the last century.\n*In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was around\n4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio should have\nan earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the inverse of that num-\nber (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a “suggested maximum” P/E\nratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this paragraph Graham recommends that\nthe “average” stock be priced about 20% below the “maximum” ratio. That\nsuggests that—in general—Graham would consider stocks selling at no more\nthan 17 times their three-year average earnings to be potentially attractive\ngiven today’s interest rates and market conditions. As of December 31,\n2002, more than 200—or better than 40%—of the stocks in the S & P 500-\nstock index had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower.

We exclude one crite-\nrion from our tests of public-utility stocks—namely, the ratio of\ncurrent assets to current liabilities. The working-capital factor takes\ncare of itself in this industry as part of the continuous financing of\nits growth by sales of bonds and shares. We do require an adequate\nproportion of stock capital to debt.4\nIn Table 14-4 we present a résumé of the 15 issues in the Dow\nJones public-utility average. For comparison, Table 14-5 gives a\nsimilar picture of a random selection of fifteen other utilities taken\nfrom the New York Stock Exchange list.\nAs 1972 began the defensive investor could have had quite a\nwide choice of utility common stocks, each of which would have\nmet our requirements for both performance and price. These com-\npanies offered him everything he had a right to demand from\nsimply chosen common-stock investments. In comparison with\nprominent industrial companies as represented by the DJIA, they\noffered almost as good a record of past growth, plus smaller fluctu-\nations in the annual figures—both at a lower price in relation to\nearnings and assets. The dividend return was significantly higher.\nThe position of the utilities as regulated monopolies is assuredly\nmore of an advantage than a disadvantage for the conservative\ninvestor. Under law they are entitled to charge rates sufficiently\nremunerative to attract the capital they need for their continuous\nexpansion, and this implies adequate offsets to inflated costs.\nWhile the process of regulation has often been cumbersome and\nperhaps dilatory, it has not prevented the utilities from earning a\nfair return on their rising invested capital over many decades.\nceled and decommissioned nuclear energy plants; nor did he foresee the\nconsequences of bungled regulation in California. Utility stocks are vastly\nmore volatile than they were in Graham’s day, and most investors should\nown them only through a well-diversified, low-cost fund like the Dow Jones\nU.S. Utilities Sector Index Fund (ticker symbol: IDU) or Utilities Select Sec-\ntor SPDR (XLU).

This means that he can ignore stockmar-\nket considerations, if he wishes, and consider himself primarily as\na part owner of well-established and well-earning businesses. The\nmarket quotations are always there for him to take advantage of\nwhen times are propitious—either for purchases at unusually\nattractive low levels, or for sales when their prices seem definitely\ntoo high.\nThe market record of the public-utility indexes—condensed in\nTable 14-6, along with those of other groups—indicates that there\nhave been ample possibilities of profit in these investments in the\npast. While the rise has not been as great as in the industrial index,\nthe individual utilities have shown more price stability in most\nperiods than have other groups.* It is striking to observe in this\ntable that the relative price/earnings ratios of the industrials and\nthe utilities have changed places during the past two decades.\nTABLE 14-6 Development of Prices and Price/Earnings Ratios\nfor Various Standard & Poor’s Averages,\n1948–1970.\nIndustrials Railroads Utilities\nYear Pricea P/E Ratio Pricea P/E Ratio Pricea P/E Ratio\n1948 15.34 6.56 15.27 4.55 16.77 10.03\n1953 24.84 9.56 22.60 5.42 24.03 14.00\n1958 58.65 19.88 34.23 12.45 43.13 18.59\n1963 79.25 18.18 40.65 12.78 66.42 20.44\n1968 113.02 17.80 54.15 14.21 69.69 15.87\n1970 100.00 17.84 34.40 12.83 61.75 13.16\naPrices are at the close of the year.\n*In a remarkable confirmation of Graham’s point, the dull-sounding Stan-\ndard & Poor’s Utility Index outperformed the vaunted NASDAQ Composite\nIndex for the 30 years ending December 31, 2002.\nwww.fx1618.com360 The Intelligent Investor\nThese reversals will have more meaning for the active than for the\npassive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios\nshould be changed from time to time, especially if the securities\npurchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be\nreplaced by issues much more reasonably priced. Alas! there will\nbe capital-gains taxes to pay—which for the typical investor seems\nto be about the same as the Devil to pay. Our old ally, experience,\ntells us here that it is better to sell and pay the tax than not sell and\nrepent.\nInvesting in Stocks of Financial Enterprises\nA considerable variety of concerns may be ranged under the\nrubric of “financial companies.” These would include banks,\ninsurance companies, savings and loan associations, credit and\nsmall-loan companies, mortgage companies, and “investment\ncompanies” (e.g., mutual funds).* It is characteristic of all these\nenterprises that they have a relatively small part of their assets in\nthe form of material things—such as fixed assets and merchandise\ninventories—but on the other hand most categories have short-\nterm obligations well in excess of their stock capital. The question\nof financial soundness is, therefore, more relevant here than in the\ncase of the typical manufacturing or commercial enterprise. This,\nin turn, has given rise to various forms of regulation and supervi-\nsion, with the design and general result of assuring against\nunsound financial practices.\nBroadly speaking, the shares of financial concerns have pro-\nduced investment results similar to those of other types of common\nshares. Table 14-7 shows price changes between 1948 and 1970 in\nsix groups represented in the Standard & Poor’s stock-price\nindexes. The average for 1941–1943 is taken as 10, the base level.\n*Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more components,\nincluding commercial banks; savings & loan and mortgage-financing compa-\nnies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card issuers; money managers and\ntrust companies; investment banks and brokerages; insurance companies;\nand firms engaged in developing or owning real estate, including real-estate\ninvestment trusts.

(Their labor-cost problem has of362 The Intelligent Investor\ncourse been difficult as well, but that has not been confined to rail-\nroads.) Automobiles, buses, and airlines have drawn off most of\ntheir passenger business and left the rest highly unprofitable; the\ntrucks have taken a good deal of their freight traffic. More than half\nof the railroad mileage of the country has been in bankruptcy (or\n“trusteeship”) at various times during the past 50 years.\nBut this half-century has not been all downhill for the carriers.\nThere have been prosperous periods for the industry, especially the\nwar years. Some of the lines have managed to maintain their earn-\ning power and their dividends despite the general difficulties.\nThe Standard & Poor’s index advanced sevenfold from the low\nof 1942 to the high of 1968, not much below the percentage gain in\nthe public-utility index. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Trans-\nportation Co., our most important railroad, in 1970 shocked the\nfinancial world. Only a year and two years previously the stock\nsold at close to the highest price level in its long history, and it had\npaid continuous dividends for more than 120 years! (On p. 423\nbelow we present a brief analysis of this railroad to illustrate how a\ncompetent student could have detected the developing weaknesses\nin the company’s picture and counseled against ownership of its\nsecurities.) The market level of railroad shares as a whole was seri-\nously affected by this financial disaster.\nIt is usually unsound to make blanket recommendations of\nwhole classes of securities, and there are equal objections to broad\ncondemnations. The record of railroad share prices in Table 14-6\nshows that the group as a whole has often offered chances for a\nlarge profit. (But in our view the great advances were in them-\nselves largely unwarranted.) Let us confine our suggestion to this:\nThere is no compelling reason for the investor to own railroad\nshares; before he buys any he should make sure that he is getting\nso much value for his money that it would be unreasonable to look\nfor something else instead.*\n*Only a few major rail stocks now remain, including Burlington Northern,\nCSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this section is at\nleast as relevant to airline stocks today—with their massive current losses\nand a half-century of almost incessantly poor results—as it was to railroads\nin Graham’s day.\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the DefensiveInvestor 363\nSelectivity for the Defensive Investor\nEvery investor would like his list to be better or more promising\nthan the average. Hence the reader will ask whether, if he gets him-\nself a competent adviser or security analyst, he should not be able to\ncount on being supplied with an investment package of really supe-\nrior merits. “After all,” he may say, “the rules you have outlined are\npretty simple and easygoing. Ahighly trained analyst ought to be\nable to use all his skill and techniques to improve substantially on\nsomething as obvious as the Dow Jones list. If not, what good are all\nhis statistics, calculations, and pontifical judgments?”\nSuppose, as a practical test, we had asked a hundred security\nanalysts to choose the “best” five stocks in the Dow Jones Average,\nto be bought at the end of 1970. Few would have come up with\nidentical choices and many of the lists would have differed com-\npletely from each other.\nThis is not so surprising as it may at first appear. The underlying\nreason is that the current price of each prominent stock pretty well\nreflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general\nopinion as to its future prospects. Hence the view of any analyst that\none stock is a better buy than the rest must arise to a great extent\nfrom his personal partialities and expectations, or from the placing\nof his emphasis on one set of factors rather than on another in his\nwork of evaluation. If all analysts were agreed that one particular\nstock was better than all the rest, that issue would quickly advance\nto a price which would offset all of its previous advantages.*\n*Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH, an aca-\ndemic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates all publicly\navailable information about the company. With millions of investors scouring\nthe market every day, it is unlikely that severe mispricings can persist for\nlong. An old joke has two finance professors walking along the sidewalk;\nwhen one spots a $20 bill and bends over to pick it up, the other grabs his\narm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was really a $20 bill, someone would have\ntaken it already.” While the market is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close\nmost of the time—so the intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock\nmarket’s $20 bills only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the\ncosts of trading and taxes.\nwww.fx1618.com364 The Intelligent Investor\nOur statement that the current price reflects both known facts\nand future expectations was intended to emphasize the double\nbasis for market valuations. Corresponding with these two kinds\nof value elements are two basically different approaches to security\nanalysis. To be sure, every competent analyst looks forward to the\nfuture rather than backward to the past, and he realizes that his\nwork will prove good or bad depending on what willhappen and\nnot on what has happened. Nevertheless, the future itself can be\napproached in two different ways, which may be called the way of\nprediction(or projection) and the way of protection.*\nThose who emphasize prediction will endeavor to anticipate\nfairly accurately just what the company will accomplish in future\nyears—in particular whether earnings will show pronounced and\npersistent growth. These conclusions may be based on a very care-\nful study of such factors as supply and demand in the industry—or\nvolume, price, and costs—or else they may be derived from a\nrather naïve projection of the line of past growth into the future. If\nthese authorities are convinced that the fairly long-term prospects\nare unusually favorable, they will almost always recommend the\nstock for purchase without paying too much regard to the level at\nwhich it is selling. Such, for example, was the general attitude with\nrespect to the air-transport stocks—an attitude that persisted for\nmany years despite the distressingly bad results often shown after\n1946. In the Introduction we have commented on the disparity\nbetween the strong price action and the relatively disappointing\nearnings record of this industry.\n*This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors labor\nunder a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for the future.\nAnd, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain. Inflation and inter-\nest rates are undependable; economic recessions come and go at random;\ngeopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages, and terrorism arrive\nwithout warning; and the fate of individual companies and their industries\noften turns out to be the opposite of what most investors expect. Therefore,\ninvesting on the basis of projectionis a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of\nthe so-called experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most peo-\nple, investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and\nfrom overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best solu-\ntion. Grawhamw ewxp.afnxd1s 6on1 th8is. ccoonmcept in Chapter 20.Stock Selection for the DefensiveInvestor 365\nBy contrast, those who emphasize protection are always espe-\ncially concerned with the price of the issue at the time of study.\nTheir main effort is to assure themselves of a substantial margin of\nindicated present value above the market price—which margin\ncould absorb unfavorable developments in the future. Generally\nspeaking, therefore, it is not so necessary for them to be enthusias-\ntic over the company’s long-run prospects as it is to be reasonably\nconfident that the enterprise will get along.\nThe first, or predictive, approach could also be called the quali-\ntative approach, since it emphasizes prospects, management, and\nother nonmeasurable, albeit highly important, factors that go\nunder the heading of quality. The second, or protective, approach\nmay be called the quantitative or statistical approach, since it\nemphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and\nearnings, assets, dividends, and so forth. Incidentally, the quantita-\ntive method is really an extension—into the field of common\nstocks—of the viewpoint that security analysis has found to be\nsound in the selection of bonds and preferred stocks for invest-\nment.\nIn our own attitude and professional work we were always\ncommitted to the quantitative approach. From the first we wanted\nto make sure that we were getting ample value for our money in\nconcrete, demonstrable terms. We were not willing to accept the\nprospects and promises of the future as compensation for a lack of\nsufficient value in hand. This has by no means been the standard\nviewpoint among investment authorities; in fact, the majority\nwould probably subscribe to the view that prospects, quality of\nmanagement, other intangibles, and “the human factor” far out-\nweigh the indications supplied by any study of the past record, the\nbalance sheet, and all the other cold figures.\nThus this matter of choosing the “best” stocks is at bottom a\nhighly controversial one. Our advice to the defensive investor is\nthat he let it alone. Let him emphasize diversification more than\nindividual selection. Incidentally, the universally accepted idea of\ndiversification is, in part at least, the negation of the ambitious pre-\ntensions of selectivity. If one couldselect the best stocks unerringly,\none would only lose by diversifying. Yet within the limits of the\nfour most general rules of common-stock selection suggested for\nthe defensive investor (on pp. 114–115) there is room for a rather\nconswidewrawbl.ef xfr1ee6d1om8 .ocf oprmeference. At the worst the indulgence of366 The Intelligent Investor\nsuch preferences should do no harm; beyond that, it may add\nsomething worthwhile to the results. With the increasing impact of\ntechnological developments on long-term corporate results, the\ninvestor cannot leave them out of his calculations. Here, as else-\nwhere, he must seek a mean between neglect and overemphasis.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 14\nHe that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly grow to great\nriches; and he that puts all upon adventures, doth oftentimes\nbreak and come to poverty: it is good therefore to guard adven-\ntures with certainties that may uphold losses.\n—Sir Francis Bacon\nGETTING STARTED\nHow should you tackle the nitty-gritty work of stock selection? Gra-\nham suggests that the defensive investor can, “most simply,” buy every\nstock in the DowJones Industrial Average. Today’s defensive investor\ncan do even better—by buying a total stock-market index fund that\nholds essentially every stock worth having. A low-cost index fund is\nthe best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing—and\nany effort to improve on it takes more work (and incurs more risk and\nhigher costs) than a truly defensive investor can justify.\nResearching and selecting your own stocks is not necessary; for\nmost people, it is not even advisable. However, some defensive\ninvestors do enjoy the diversion and intellectual challenge of picking\nindividual stocks—and, if you have survived a bear market and still\nenjoy stock picking, then nothing that Graham or I could say will dis-\nsuade you. In that case, instead of making a total stock market index\nfund your complete portfolio, make it the foundation of your portfolio.\nOnce you have that foundation in place, you can experiment around\nthe edges with your own stock choices. Keep 90% of your stock\nmoney in an index fund, leaving 10% with which to try picking your\nown stocks. Only after you build that solid core should you explore.\n(To learn why such broad diversification is so important, please see\nthe sidebar on the following page.)\nwww.fx1618.com\n367368 Commentary on Chapter 14\nWHY DIVERSIFY?\nDuring the bull market of the 1990s, one of the most common\ncriticisms of diversification was that it lowers your potential for\nhigh returns. After all, if you could identify the next Microsoft,\nwouldn’t it make sense for you to put all your eggs into that one\nbasket?\nWell, sure. As the humorist Will Rogers once said, “Don’t\ngamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock and\nhold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t buy it.”\nHowever, as Rogers knew, 20/20 foresight is not a gift\ngranted to most investors. No matter how confident we feel,\nthere’s no way to find out whether a stock will go up until after\nwe buy it. Therefore, the stock you think is “the next Micro-\nsoft” may well turn out to be the next MicroStrategy instead.\n(That former market star went from $3,130 per share in March\n2000 to $15.10 at year-end 2002, an apocalyptic loss of\n99.5%).1 Keeping your money spread across many stocks and\nindustries is the only reliable insurance against the risk of being\nwrong.\nBut diversification doesn’t just minimize your odds of being\nwrong. It also maximizes your chances of being right. Over long\nperiods of time, a handful of stocks turn into “superstocks” that\ngo up 10,000% or more. Money Magazine identified the 30\nbest-performing stocks over the 30 years ending in 2002—and,\neven with 20/20 hindsight, the list is startlingly unpredictable.\nRather than lots of technology or health-care stocks, it includes\nSouthwest Airlines, Worthington Steel, Dollar General discount\nstores, and snuff-tobacco maker UST Inc.2 If you think you\nwould have been willing to bet big on any of those stocks back\nin 1972, you are kidding yourself.\nThink of it this way: In the huge market haystack, only a few\nneedles ever go on to generate truly gigantic gains. The more of\nthe haystack you own, the higher the odds go that you will end\nup finding at least one of those needles. By owning the entire\nhaystack (ideally through an index fund that tracks the total U.S.\nstock market) you can be sure to find every needle, thus captur-\ning the returns of all the superstocks. Especially if you are a\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 14 369\ndefensive investor, why look for the needles when you can own\nthe whole haystack?\n1Adjusted for stock splits. To many people, MicroStrategy really did look like\nthe next Microsoft in early 2000; its stock had gained 566.7% in 1999, and its\nchairman, Michael Saylor, declared that “our future today is better than it was\n18 months ago.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later accused\nMicroStrategy of accounting fraud, and Saylor paid an $8.3 million fine to set-\ntle the charges.\n2Jon Birger, “The 30 Best Stocks,” Money,Fall 2002, pp. 88–95.\nTESTING, TESTING\nLet’s briefly update Graham’s criteria for stock selection.\nAdequate size. Nowadays, “to exclude small companies,” most\ndefensive investors should steer clear of stocks with a total market value\nof less than $2 billion. In early 2003, that still left you with 437 of the\ncompanies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to choose from.\nHowever, today’s defensive investors—unlike those in Graham’s day—\ncan conveniently own small companies by buying a mutual fund special-\nizing in small stocks. Again, an index fund like Vanguard Small-Cap Index\nis the first choice, although active funds are available at reasonable cost\nfrom such firms as Ariel, T. Rowe Price, Royce, and Third Avenue.\nStrong financial condition.According to market strategists Steve\nGalbraith and Jay Lasus of Morgan Stanley, at the beginning of 2003\nabout 120 of the companies in the S & P 500 index met Graham’s\ntest of a 2-to-1 current ratio. With current assets at least twice their\ncurrent liabilities, these firms had a sizeable cushion of working capital\nthat—on average—should sustain them through hard times.\nWall Street has always abounded in bitter ironies, and the bursting\nof the growth-stock bubble has created a doozy: In 1999 and 2000,\nhigh-tech, bio-tech, and telecommunications stocks were supposed to\nprovide “aggressive growth” and ended up giving most of their\ninvestors aggressive shrinkage instead. But, by early 2003, the wheel\nhad come full circle, and many of those aggressive growth stocks had\nbecome financially conservative—loaded with working capital, rich in\ncash, and often debt-free.

Graham’s criterion of financial strength still works: If you build\na diversified basket of stocks whose current assets are at least double\ntheir current liabilities, and whose long-term debt does not exceed\nworking capital, you should end up with a group of conservatively\nfinanced companies with plenty of staying power. The best values\ntoday are often found in the stocks that were once hot and have since\ngone cold. Throughout history, such stocks have often provided the\nmargin of safety that a defensive investor demands.\nEarnings stability. According to Morgan Stanley, 86% of all the\ncompanies in the S & P 500 index have had positive earnings in every\nyear from 1993 through 2002. So Graham’s insistence on “some\nearnings for the common stock in each of the past ten years” remains\na valid test—tough enough to eliminate chronic losers, but not so\nrestrictive as to limit your choices to an unrealistically small sample.\nDividend record. As of early 2003, according to Standard &\nPoor’s, 354 companies in the S & P 500 (or 71% of the total) paid a\ndividend. No fewer than 255 companies have paid a dividend for at\nleast 20 years in a row. And, according to S & P, 57 companies in the\nindex have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\nThat’s no guarantee that they will do so forever, but it’s a comfort-\ning sign.\nEarnings growth. How many companies in the S & P 500\nincreased their earnings per share by “at least one third,” as Graham\nrequires, over the 10 years ending in 2002? (We’ll average each\ncompany’s earnings from 1991 through 1993, and then determine\nwhether the average earnings from 2000 through 2002 were at least\n33% higher.) According to Morgan Stanley, 264 companies in the\nS & P 500 met that test. But here, it seems, Graham set a very low\nhurdle; 33% cumulative growth over a decade is less than a 3% aver-\nage annual increase. Cumulative growth in earnings per share of at\nleast 50%—or a 4% average annual rise—is a bit less conservative.

(If you double the cumulative growth hurdle to 100%, or 7%\naverage annual growth, then 198 companies make the cutoff.)\nModerate P/E ratio. Graham recommends limiting yourself to\nstocks whose current price is no more than 15 times average earnings\nover the past three years. Incredibly, the prevailing practice on Wall\nStreet today is to value stocks by dividing their current price by some-\nthing called “next year’s earnings.” That gives what is sometimes\ncalled “the forward P/E ratio.” But it’s nonsensical to derive a\nprice/earnings ratio by dividing the known current price by unknown\nfuture earnings. Over the long run, money manager David Dreman has\nshown, 59% of Wall Street’s “consensus” earnings forecasts miss the\nmark by a mortifyingly wide margin—either underestimating or overesti-\nmating the actual reported earnings by at least 15%.2 Investing your\nmoney on the basis of what these myopic soothsayers predict for the\ncoming year is as risky as volunteering to hold up the bulls-eye at an\narchery tournament for the legally blind. Instead, calculate a stock’s\nprice/earnings ratio yourself, using Graham’s formula of current price\ndivided by average earnings over the past three years.3\nAs of early 2003, how many stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500\nindex were valued at no more than 15 times their average earnings of\n2000 through 2002? According to Morgan Stanley, a generous total\nof 185 companies passed Graham’s test.\nModerate price-to-book ratio. Graham recommends a “ratio of\nprice to assets” (or price-to-book-value ratio) of no more than 1.5. In\nrecent years, an increasing proportion of the value of companies has\ncome from intangible assets like franchises, brand names, and patents\nand trademarks. Since these factors (along with goodwill from acqui-\nsitions) are excluded from the standard definition of book value, most\ncompanies today are priced at higher price-to-book multiples than in\nGraham’s day. According to Morgan Stanley, 123 of the companies in\nthe S & P 500 (or one in four) are priced below 1.5 times book value.\n2David Dreman, “Bubbles and the Role of Analysts’ Forecasts,” The Journal\nof Psychology and Financial Markets,vol. 3, no. 1 (2002), pp. 4–14.\n3You can calculate this ratio by hand from a company’s annual reports or\nobtain the data at websites like www.morningstar.com or http://finance.\nyahoo.cowm.ww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 14 375\nAll told, 273 companies (or 55% of the index) have price-to-book\nratios of less than 2.5.\nWhat about Graham’s suggestion that you multiply the P/E ratio by\nthe price-to-book ratio and see whether the resulting number is below\n22.5? Based on data from Morgan Stanley, at least 142 stocks in the\nS & P 500 could pass that test as of early 2003, including Dana\nCorp., Electronic Data Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Washington\nMutual. So Graham’s “blended multiplier” still works as an initial\nscreen to identify reasonably-priced stocks.\nDUE DILIGENCE\nNo matter how defensive an investor you are—in Graham’s sense of\nwishing to minimize the work you put into picking stocks—there are a\ncouple of steps you cannot afford to skip:\nDo your homework. Through the EDGAR database at www.sec.\ngov, you get instant access to a company’s annual and quarterly\nreports, along with the proxy statement that discloses the managers’\ncompensation, ownership, and potential conflicts of interest. Read at\nleast five years’ worth.4\nCheck out the neighborhood. Websites like http://quicktake.\nmorningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com and www.quicken.com can\nreadily tell you what percentage of a company’s shares are owned by\ninstitutions. Anything over 60% suggests that a stock is scarcely\nundiscovered and probably “overowned.” (When big institutions sell,\nthey tend to move in lockstep, with disastrous results for the stock.\nImagine all the Radio City Rockettes toppling off the front edge of the\nstage at once and you get the idea.) Those websites will also tell you\nwho the largest owners of the stock are.

Our empha-\nsis in selection has been chiefly on exclusions—advising on the one\nhand against all issues of recognizably poor quality, and on the\nother against the highest-quality issues if their price is so high as to\ninvolve a considerable speculative risk. In this chapter, addressed\nto the enterprising investor, we must consider the possibilities and\nthe means of making individualselections which are likely to prove\nmore profitable than an across-the-board average.\nWhat are the prospects of doing this successfully? We would be\nless than frank, as the euphemism goes, if we did not at the outset\nexpress some grave reservations on this score. At first blush the\ncase for successful selection appears self-evident. To get average\nresults—e.g., equivalent to the performance of the DJIA—should\nrequire no special ability of any kind. All that is needed is a portfo-\nlio identical with, or similar to, those thirty prominent issues.\nSurely, then, by the exercise of even a moderate degree of skill—\nderived from study, experience, and native ability—it should be\npossible to obtain substantially better results than the DJIA.\nYet there is considerable and impressive evidence to the effect\nthat this is very hard to do, even though the qualifications of those\ntrying it are of the highest. The evidence lies in the record of the\nnumerous investment companies, or “funds,” which have been in\noperation for many years. Most of these funds are large enough to\ncommand the services of the best financial or security analysts in\nthe field, together with all the other constituents of an adequate\nresearch department. Their expenses of operation, when spread\nwww.fx1618.com\n376Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 377\nover their ample capital, average about one-half of 1% a year\nthereon, or less. These costs are not negligible in themselves; but\nwhen they are compared with the approximately 15% annual over-\nall return on common stocks generally in the decade 1951–1960,\nand even the 6% return in 1961–1970, they do not bulk large. A\nsmall amount of superior selective ability should easily have over-\ncome that expense handicap and brought in a superior net result\nfor the fund shareholders.\nTaken as a whole, however, the all-common-stock funds failed\nover a long span of years to earn quite as good a return as was\nshown on Standard & Poor’s 500-stock averages or the market as a\nwhole. This conclusion has been substantiated by several compre-\nhensive studies. To quote the latest one before us, covering the\nperiod 1960–1968:*\nIt appears from these results that random portfolios of New\nYork Stock Exchange stocks with equal investment in each stock\nperformed on the average better over the period than did mutual\nfunds in the same risk class. The differences were fairly substantial\nfor the low- and medium-risk portfolios (3.7% and 2.5% respec-\ntively per annum), but quite small for the high-risk portfolios\n(0.2% per annum).1\nAs we pointed out in Chapter 9, these comparative figures in no\nway invalidate the usefulness of the investment funds as a finan-\ncial institution. For they do make available to all members of the\n*The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through June\n1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual funds\nagainst the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more than 500\nof the largest stocks listed on the NYSE. The funds in the Friend-Blume-\nCrockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had in the first half\nof the measurement period, much as Graham found in his own research\n(see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did not last. And\nthe thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average, underperform the\nmarket by a margin roughly equal to their operating expenses and trading\ncosts—has been reconfirmed so many times that anyone who doubts them\nshould found a financial chapter of The Flat Earth Society.\nwww.fx1618.com378 The Intelligent Investor\ninvesting public the possibility of obtaining approximately average\nresults on their common-stock commitments. For a variety of rea-\nsons, most members of the public who put their money in common\nstocks of their own choice fail to do nearly as well. But to the objec-\ntive observer the failure of the funds to better the performance\nof a broad average is a pretty conclusive indication that such an\nachievement, instead of being easy, is in fact extremely difficult.\nWhy should this be so? We can think of two different explana-\ntions, each of which may be partially applicable. The first is the\npossibility that the stock market does in fact reflect in the current\nprices not only all the important facts about the companies’ past\nand current performance, but also whatever expectations can be\nreasonably formed as to their future. If this is so, then the diverse\nmarket movements which subsequently take place—and these are\noften extreme—must be the result of new developments and prob-\nabilities that could not be reliably foreseen. This would make the\nprice movements essentially fortuitous and random. To the extent\nthat the foregoing is true, the work of the security analyst—how-\never intelligent and thorough—must be largely ineffective, because\nin essence he is trying to predict the unpredictable.\nThe very multiplication of the number of security analysts may\nhave played an important part in bringing about this result. With\nhundreds, even thousands, of experts studying the value factors\nbehind an important common stock, it would be natural to expect\nthat its current price would reflect pretty well the consensus of\ninformed opinion on its value. Those who would prefer it to other\nissues would do so for reasons of personal partiality or optimism\nthat could just as well be wrong as right.\nWe have often thought of the analogy between the work of the\nhost of security analysts on Wall Street and the performance of\nmaster bridge players at a duplicate-bridge tournament. The for-\nmer try to pick the stocks “most likely to succeed”; the latter to get\ntop score for each hand played. Only a limited few can accomplish\neither aim. To the extent that all the bridge players have about the\nsame level of expertness, the winners are likely to be determined\nby “breaks” of various sorts rather than superior skill. On Wall\nStreet the leveling process is helped along by the freemasonry that\nexists in the profession, under which ideas and discoveries are\nquite freely shared at the numerous get-togethers of various sorts.\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 379\nIt is almost as if, at the analogous bridge tournament, the various\nexperts were looking over each other’s shoulders and arguing out\neach hand as it was played.\nThe second possibility is of a quite different sort. Perhaps many\nof the security analysts are handicapped by a flaw in their basic\napproach to the problem of stock selection. They seek the indus-\ntries with the best prospects of growth, and the companies in these\nindustries with the best management and other advantages. The\nimplication is that they will buy into such industries and such com-\npanies at any price, however high, and they will avoid less promis-\ning industries and companies no matter how low the price of their\nshares. This would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of\nthe good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely\nin the future, for then in theory their value would be infinite. And\nif the less promising companies were headed for extinction, with\nno salvage, the analysts would be right to consider them unattrac-\ntive at any price.\nThe truth about our corporate ventures is quite otherwise.\nExtremely few companies have been able to show a high rate of\nuninterrupted growth for long periods of time. Remarkably few,\nalso, of the larger companies suffer ultimate extinction. For most,\ntheir history is one of vicissitudes, of ups and downs, of change in\ntheir relative standing. In some the variations “from rags to riches\nand back” have been repeated on almost a cyclical basis—the\nphrase used to be a standard one applied to the steel industry—for\nothers spectacular changes have been identified with deterioration\nor improvement of management.*\nHow does the foregoing inquiry apply to the enterprising\ninvestor who would like to make individual selections that will\nyield superior results? It suggests first of all that he is taking on a\n*As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several other\nreasons mutual funds have not been able to outperform the market aver-\nages, including the low returns on the funds’ cash balances and the high\ncosts of researching and trading stocks.

Readers of this\nbook, however intelligent and knowing, could scarcely expect to\ndo a better job of portfolio selection than the top analysts of the\ncountry. But if it is true that a fairly large segment of the stock mar-\nket is often discriminated against or entirely neglected in the stan-\ndard analytical selections, then the intelligent investor may be in a\nposition to profit from the resultant undervaluations.\nBut to do so he must follow specific methods that are not gener-\nally accepted on Wall Street, since those that are so accepted do not\nseem to produce the results everyone would like to achieve. It\nwould be rather strange if—with all the brains at work profession-\nally in the stock market—there could be approaches which are both\nsound and relatively unpopular. Yet our own career and reputation\nhave been based on this unlikely fact.*\nASummary of the Graham-Newman Methods\nTo give concreteness to the last statement, it should be worth-\nwhile to give a brief account of the types of operations we engaged\nin during the thirty-year life of Graham-Newman Corporation,\nbetween 1926 and 1956.† These were classified in our records as\nfollows:\nArbitrages:The purchase of a security and the simultaneous sale\n*In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is summarizing the\nEfficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the contrary, the prob-\nlem with the stock market today is not that so many financial analysts are\nidiots, but rather that so many of them are so smart. As more and more\nsmart people search the market for bargains, that very act of searching\nmakes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel paradox, makes the analysts look\nas if they lack the intelligence to justify the search. The market’s valuation of\na given stock is the result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of col-\nlective intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective intelli-\ngence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does Graham’s\n“Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of whack.\n†Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved\nit when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the suc-\ncessor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account, which\nhe ran frowmw Jawnu.afryx 1196261, 8th.rocuoghm December 1935.Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 381\nof one or more other securities into which it was to be exchanged\nunder a plan of reorganization, merger, or the like.\nLiquidations: Purchase of shares which were to receive one or\nmore cash payments in liquidation of the company’s assets.\nOperations of these two classes were selected on the twin basis\nof (a) a calculated annual return of 20% or more, and (b) our judg-\nment that the chance of a successful outcome was at least four out\nof five.\nRelated Hedges:The purchase of convertible bonds or convertible\npreferred shares, and the simultaneous sale of the common stock\ninto which they were exchangeable. The position was established\nat close to a parity basis—i.e., at a small maximum loss if the senior\nissue had actually to be converted and the operation closed out in\nthat way. But a profit would be made if the common stock fell con-\nsiderably more than the senior issue, and the position closed out in\nthe market.\nNet-Current-Asset (or “Bargain”) Issues: The idea here was to\nacquire as many issues as possible at a cost for each of less than\ntheir book value in terms of net-current-assets alone—i.e., giving\nno value to the plant account and other assets. Our purchases were\nmade typically at two-thirds or less of such stripped-down asset\nvalue. In most years we carried a wide diversification here—at\nleast 100 different issues.\nWe should add that from time to time we had some large-scale\nacquisitions of the control type, but these are not relevant to the\npresent discussion.\nWekept close track of the results shown by each class of opera-\ntion. In consequence of these follow-ups we discontinued two\nbroader fields, which were found not to have shown satisfactory\noverall results. The first was the purchase of apparently attractive\nissues—based on our general analysis—which were not obtainable\nat less than their working-capital value alone. The second were\n“unrelated” hedging operations, in which the purchased security\nwas not exchangeable for the common shares sold. (Such opera-\ntions correspond roughly to those recently embarked on by the\nnew group of “hedge funds” in the investment-company field.* In\n*An “unrelated” hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by one com-\npany wanwd swho.rftx-s1ell6ing1 (8or. cbeottming on a decline in) a security issued by a dif-382 The Intelligent Investor\nboth cases a study of the results realized by us over a period of ten\nyears or more led us to conclude that the profits were not suffi-\nciently dependable—and the operations not sufficiently “headache\nproof”—to justify our continuing them.\nHence from 1939 on our operations were limited to “self-\nliquidating” situations, related hedges, working-capital bargains,\nand a few control operations. Each of these classes gave us quite\nconsistently satisfactory results from then on, with the special fea-\nture that the related hedges turned in good profits in the bear mar-\nkets when our “undervalued issues” were not doing so well.\nWe hesitate to prescribe our own diet for any large number of\nintelligent investors. Obviously, the professional techniques we\nhave followed are not suitable for the defensive investor, who by\ndefinition is an amateur. As for the aggressive investor, perhaps\nonly a small minority of them would have the type of temperament\nneeded to limit themselves so severely to only a relatively small\npart of the world of securities. Most active-minded practitioners\nwould prefer to venture into wider channels. Their natural hunting\ngrounds would be the entire field of securities that they felt (a)\nwere certainly not overvalued by conservative measures, and (b)\nappeared decidedly more attractive—because of their prospects or\npast record, or both—than the average common stock. In such\nchoices they would do well to apply various tests of quality and\nprice-reasonableness along the lines we have proposed for the\ndefensive investor. But they should be less inflexible, permitting a\nconsiderable plus in one factor to offset a small black mark in\nanother. For example, he might not rule out a company which had\nshown a deficit in a year such as 1970, if large average earnings and\nother important attributes made the stock look cheap. The enter-\nprising investor may confine his choice to industries and compa-\nnies about which he holds an optimistic view, but we counsel\nstrongly against paying a high price for a stock (in relation to earn-\nferent company. A “related” hedge involves buying and selling different\nstocks or bonds issued by the same company. The “new group” of hedge\nfunds described by Graham were widely available around 1968, but later\nregulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission restricted ac-\ncess to hedge funds for the general public.\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 383\nings and assets) because of such enthusiasm. If he followed our\nphilosophy in this field he would more likely be the buyer of\nimportant cyclical enterprises—such as steel shares perhaps—\nwhen the current situation is unfavorable, the near-term prospects\nare poor, and the low price fully reflects the current pessimism.*\nSecondary Companies\nNext in order for examination and possible selection would come\nsecondary companies that are making a good showing, have a satis-\nfactory past record, but appear to hold no charm for the public.\nThese would be enterprises on the order of eltra and Emhart at\ntheir 1970 closing prices.

We should like to try\na novel approach here and give a reasonably detailed exposition of\none such exercise in stock selection. Ours is a double purpose. Many\nof our readers may find a substantial practical value in the method\nwe shall follow, or it may suggest comparable methods to try out.\nBeyond that what we shall do may help them to come to grips with\nthe real world of common stocks, and introduce them to one of the\nmost fascinating and valuable little volumes in existence. It is Stan-\ndard & Poor’s Stock Guide,published monthly, and made available\nto the general public under annual subscription. In addition many\nbrokerage firms distribute the Guideto their clients (on request.)\nThe great bulk of the Guide is given over to about 230 pages of\ncondensed statistical information on the stocks of more than 4,500\ncompanies. These include all the issues listed on the various\nexchanges, say 3,000, plus some 1,500 unlisted issues. Most of the\nitems needed for a first and even a second look at a given company\nappear in this compendium. (From our viewpoint the important\nmissing datum is the net-asset-value, or book value, per share,\nwhich can be found in the larger Standard & Poor’s volumes and\nelsewhere.)\n*In 2003, an intelligent investor following Graham’s train of thought would\nbe searching for opportunities in the technology, telecommunications, and\nelectric-utility industries. History has shown that yesterday’s losers are often\ntomorrow’s winners.\nwww.fx1618.com384 The Intelligent Investor\nThe investor who likes to play around with corporate figures\nwill find himself in clover with the Stock Guide.He can open to any\npage and see before his eyes a condensed panorama of the splen-\ndors and miseries of the stock market, with all-time high and low\nprices going as far back as 1936, when available. He will find com-\npanies that have multiplied their price 2,000 times from the minus-\ncule low to the majestic high. (For prestigious IBM the growth was\n“only” 333 times in that period.) He will find (not so exceptionally)\na company whose shares advanced from 3⁄ to 68, and then fell back\n8\nto 3.2In the dividend record column he will find one that goes back\nto 1791—paid by Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island (which\nrecently saw fit to change its ancient corporate name).* If he looks\nat the Guide for the year-end 1969 he will read that Penn Central\nCo. (as successor to Pennsylvania Railroad) has been paying divi-\ndends steadily since 1848; alas!, it was doomed to bankruptcy a\nfew months later. He will find a company selling at only 2 times its\nlast reported earnings, and another selling at 99 times such earn-\nings.3In most cases he will find it difficult to tell the line of business\nfrom the corporate name; for one U.S. Steel there will be three\ncalled such things as ITI Corp. (bakery stuff) or Santa Fe Industries\n(mainly the large railroad). He can feast on an extraordinary vari-\nety of price histories, dividend and earnings histories, financial\npositions, capitalization setups, and what not. Backward-leaning\nconservatism, run-of-the-mine featureless companies, the most\npeculiar combinations of “principal business,” all kinds of Wall\nStreet gadgets and widgets—they are all there, waiting to be\nbrowsed over, or studied with a serious objective.\nTheGuidesgive in separate columns the current dividend yields\nand price/earnings ratios, based on latest 12-month figures, wher-\never applicable.

The first such clue that comes to mind is a low price in\nrelation to recent earnings. Let’s make a preliminary list of stocks\nthat sold at a multiple of nine or less at the end of 1970. That datum\nis conveniently provided in the last column of the even-numbered\npages. For an illustrative sample we shall take the first 20 such low-\nmultiplier stocks; they begin with the sixth issue listed, Aberdeen\nMfg. Co., which closed the year at 101⁄, or 9 times its reported earn-\n4\nings of $1.25 per share for the 12 months ended September 1970.\nThe twentieth such issue is American Maize Products, which\nclosed at 91⁄, also with a multiplier of 9.\n2\nThe group may have seemed mediocre, with 10 issues selling\nbelow $10 per share. (This fact is not truly important; it would\nprobably—not necessarily—warn defensive investors against such\na list, but the inference for enterprising investors might be favor-\nable on balance.)* Before making a further scrutiny let us calculate\nsome numbers. Our list represents about one in ten of the first 200\nissues looked at. On that basis the Guide should yield, say, 450\nissues selling at multipliers under 10. This would make a goodly\nnumber of candidates for further selectivity.\nSo let us apply to our list some additional criteria, rather similar\nto those we suggested for the defensive investor, but not so severe.\nWe suggest the following:\n1. Financial condition: (a)Current assets at least 11⁄ times current\n2\nliabilities, and (b)debt not more than 110% of net current assets\n(for industrial companies).\n*For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around $1 per share—the\nlevel below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared ineligible for trad-\ning on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock prices of these companies\ncan take a considerable amount of effort, making them impractical for defen-\nsive investors. The costs of trading low-priced stocks can be very high.\nFinally, companies with very low stock prices have a distressing tendency to\ngo out of business. However, a diversified portfolio of dozens of these dis-\ntressed companies may still appeal to some enterprising investors today.\nwww.fx1618.com386 The Intelligent Investor\n2. Earnings stability: No deficit in the last five years covered in\ntheStock Guide.\n3. Dividend record: Some current dividend.\n4. Earnings growth: Last year’s earnings more than those of 1966.\n5. Price: Less than 120% net tangible assets.\nThe earnings figures in the Guide were generally for those end-\ning September 30, 1970, and thus do not include what may be a bad\nquarter at the end of that year. But an intelligent investor can’t ask\nfor the moon—at least not to start with. Note also that we set no\nlower limit on the size of the enterprise. Small companies may\nafford enough safety if bought carefully and on a group basis.\nWhen we have applied the five additional criteria our list of 20\ncandidates is reduced to only five. Let us continue our search until\nthe first 450 issues in the Guidehave yielded us a little “portfolio”\nof 15 stocks meeting our six requirements. (They are set forth in\nTable 15–1, together with some relevant data.) The group, of\ncourse, is presented for illustration only, and would not necessarily\nhave been chosen by our inquiring investor.\nThe fact is that the user of our method would have had a much\nwider choice. If our winnowing approach had been applied to all\n4,500 companies in the Stock Guide, and if the ratio for the first\ntenth had held good throughout, we would end up with about 150\ncompanies meeting all six of our criteria of selection. The enterpris-\ning investor would then be able to follow his judgment—or his\npartialities and prejudices—in making a third selection of, say, one\nout of five in this ample list.\nThe Stock Guide material includes “Earnings and Dividend\nRankings,” which are based on stability and growth of these fac-\ntors for the past eight years. (Thus price attractiveness does not\nenter here.) We include the S & Prankings in our Table 15-1. Ten of\nthe 15 issues are ranked B+ (= average) and one (American Maize)\nis given the “high” rating of A. If our enterprising investor wanted\nto add a seventh mechanical criterion to his choice, by considering\nonly issues ranked by Standard & Poor’s as average or better in\nquality, he might still have about 100 such issues to choose from.\nOne might say that a group of issues, of at least average quality,\nmeeting criteria of financial condition as well, purchasable at a low\nmultiplier of current earnings and below asset value, should offer\ngood prwomwiswe o.ff xsa1ti6sf1ac8to.cryo imnvestment results.Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 387\nTABLE 15-1 ASample Portfolio of Low-Multiplier Industrial\nStocks\n(The First Fifteen Issues in the Stock Guide at December 31, 1971, Meeting\nSix Requirements)\nEarned\nPrice Per Share Price\nDec.

Could a single plausible criterion be used to\ngood advantage—such as a low price/earnings ratio, or a high div-\nidend return, or a large asset value? The two methods of this sort\nthat we have found to give quite consistently good results in the\nlonger past have been (a) the purchase of low-multiplier stocks of\nimportant companies (such as the DJIAlist), and (b) the choice of a\ndivewrsiwfiewd .gfxro1u6p 1o8f .sctoockms selling under their net-current-asset388 The Intelligent Investor\nvalue (or working-capital value). We have already pointed out that\nthe low-multiplier criterion applied to the DJIAat the end of 1968\nworked out badly when the results are measured to mid-1971. The\nrecord of common-stock purchases made at a price below their\nworking-capital value has no such bad mark against it; the draw-\nback here has been the drying up of such opportunities during\nmost of the past decade.\nWhat about other bases of choice? In writing this book we have\nmade a series of “experiments,” each based on a single, fairly obvi-\nous criterion. The data used would be readily found in the Stan-\ndard & Poor’s Stock Guide. In all cases a 30-stock portfolio was\nassumed to have been acquired at the 1968 closing prices and then\nrevalued at June 30, 1971. The separate criteria applied were the\nfollowing, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) Alow multi-\nplier of recent earnings (not confined to DJIA issues). (2) A high\ndividend return. (3) Avery long dividend record. (4) Avery large\nenterprise, as measured by number of outstanding shares. (5) A\nstrong financial position. (6) Alow price in dollars per share. (7) A\nlow price in relation to the previous high price. (8) Ahigh quality-\nranking by Standard & Poor’s.\nIt will be noted that the Stock Guidehas at least one column relat-\ning to each of the above criteria. This indicates the publisher’s\nbelief that each is of importance in analyzing and choosing com-\nmon stocks. (As we pointed out above, we should like to see\nanother figure added: the net-asset-value per share.)\nThe most important fact that emerges from our various tests\nrelates to the performance of stocks bought at random. We have\ntested this performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up\nof issues found on the first line of the December 31, 1968, Stock\nGuide and also found in the issue for August 31, 1971. Between\nthese two dates the S & P composite was practically unchanged,\nand the DJIA lost about 5%. But our 90 randomly chosen issues\ndeclined an average of 22%, not counting 19 issues that were\ndropped from the Guideand probably showed larger losses. These\ncomparative results undoubtedly reflect the tendency of smaller\nissues of inferior quality to be relatively overvalued in bull mar-\nkets, and not only to suffer more serious declines than the stronger\nissues in the ensuing price collapse, but also to delay their full\nrecovery—in many cases indefinitely. The moral for the intelligent\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 389\ninvestor is, of course, to avoid second-quality issues in making up\na portfolio, unless—for the enterprising investor—they are demon-\nstrable bargains.\nOther results gleaned from our portfolio studies may be sum-\nmarized as follows:\nOnly three of the groups studied showed up better than the\nS & Pcomposite (and hence better than the DJIA), viz: (1) Industri-\nals with the highest quality ranking (A+). These advanced 91⁄% in\n2\nthe period against a decline of 2.4% for the S & Pindustrials, and\n5.6% for the DJIA. (However, the ten public-utility issues rated A+\ndeclined 18% against a decline of 14% for the 55-stock S & Ppublic-\nutility index.) It is worth remarking that the S & Prankings showed\nup very well in this single test. In every case a portfolio based on a\nhigher ranking did better than a lower-ranking portfolio. (2) Com-\npanies with more than 50 million shares outstanding showed no\nchange on the whole, as against a small decline for the indexes. (3)\nStrangely enough, stocks selling at a high price per share (over 100)\nshowed a slight (1%) composite advance.\nAmong our various tests we made one based on book value, a\nfigure not given in the Stock Guide.Here we found—contrary to our\ninvestment philosophy—that companies that combined major size\nwith a large good-will component in their market price did very\nwell as a whole in the 21⁄-year holding period. (By “good-will com-\n2\nponent” we mean the part of the price that exceeds the book\nvalue.)* Our list of “good-will giants” was made up of 30 issues,\neach of which had a good-will component of over a billion dollars,\nrepresenting more than half of its market price. The total market\nvalue of these good-will items at the end of 1968 was more than\n$120 billions! Despite these optimistic market valuations the group\nas a whole showed a price advance per share of 15% between\nDecember 1968 and August 1971, and acquitted itself best among\nthe 20-odd lists studied.\nA fact like this must not be ignored in a work on investment\n*In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two causes:\na corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more than the\nvalue of their assets, or its own stock can trade for substantially more than\nits book value.\nwww.fx1618.com390 The Intelligent Investor\npolicies. It is clear that, at the least, a considerable momentum is\nattached to those companies that combine the virtues of great size,\nan excellent past record of earnings, the public’s expectation of\ncontinued earnings growth in the future, and strong market action\nover many past years. Even if the price may appear excessive by\nour quantitative standards the underlying market momentum may\nwell carry such issues along more or less indefinitely. (Naturally\nthis assumption does not apply to every individual issue in the cat-\negory. For example, the indisputable good-will leader, IBM, moved\ndown from 315 to 304 in the 30-month period.) It is difficult to\njudge to what extent the superior market action shown is due to\n“true” or objective investment merits and to what extent to long-\nestablished popularity. No doubt both factors are important here.\nClearly, both the long-term and the recent market action of the\ngood-will giants would recommend them for a diversified portfo-\nlio of common stocks. Our own preference, however, remains for\nother types that show a combination of favorable investment fac-\ntors, including asset values of at least two-thirds the market price.\nThe tests using other criteria indicate in general that random\nlists based on a single favorable factor did better than random lists\nchosen for the opposite factor—e.g., low-multiplier issues had a\nsmaller decline in this period than high-multiplier issues, and\nlong-term dividend payers lost less than those that were not pay-\ning dividends at the end of 1968. To that extent the results support\nour recommendation that the issues selected meet a combination of\nquantitative or tangible criteria.\nFinally we should comment on the much poorer showing made\nby our lists as a whole as compared with the price record of the\nS & P composite. The latter is weighted by the size of each enter-\nprise, whereas our tests are based on taking one share of each com-\npany. Evidently the larger emphasis given to giant enterprises by\nthe S & Pmethod made a significant difference in the results, and\npoints up once again their greater price stability as compared with\n“run-of-the-mine” companies.\nBargain Issues, or Net-Current-Asset Stocks\nIn the tests discussed above we did not include the results of buy-\ning 30 issues at a price less than their net-current-asset value. The rea-\nson wasw thwat won.lfyx a1 h6an1d8fu.cl, oatm most, of such issues would have beenStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 391\nfound in the Stock Guideat the end of 1968. But the picture changed in\nthe 1970 decline, and at the low prices of that year a goodly number\nof common stocks could have been bought at below their working-\ncapital value. It always seemed, and still seems, ridiculously simple\nto say that if one can acquire a diversified group of common stocks at\na price less than the applicable net current assets alone—after deduct-\ning all prior claims, and counting as zerothe fixed and other assets—\nthe results should be quite satisfactory. They were so, in our\nexperience, for more than 30 years—say, between 1923 and 1957—\nexcluding a time of real trial in 1930–1932.\nHas this approach any relevance at the beginning of 1971? Our\nanswer would be a qualified “yes.” A quick runover of the Stock\nGuidewould have uncovered some 50 or more issues that appeared\nto be obtainable at or below net-current-asset value. As might be\nexpected a good many of these had been doing badly in the diffi-\ncult year 1970. If we eliminated those which had reported net\nlosses in the last 12-month period we would be still left with\nenough issues to make up a diversified list.\nWe have included in Table 15-2 some data on five issues that\nsold at less than their working-capital value* at their low prices of\nTABLE 15-2 Stocks of Prominent Companies Selling at or Below\nNet-Current-Asset Value in 1970\nNet-Current- Book Earned High Price\n1970 Asset Value Value Per Share, Current Before\nCompany Price Per Share Per Share 1970 Dividend 1970\nCone Mills 13 $18 $39.3 $1.51 $1.00 411⁄\n2\nJantzen Inc. 111⁄ 12 16.3 1.27 .60 37\n8\nNational Presto 211⁄ 27 31.7 6.15 1.00 45\n2\nParker Pen 91⁄ 91⁄ 16.6 1.62 .60 311⁄\n4 2 4\nWest Point\nPepperell 161⁄ 201⁄ 39.4 1.82 1.50 64\n4 2\n*Technically, the working-capital value of a stock is the current assets per\nshare, minus the current liabilities per share, divided by the number of\nshares outstanding.

These give some food for reflection on the nature of stock-\nprice fluctuations. How does it come about that well-established\ncompanies, whose brands are household names all over the coun-\ntry, could be valued at such low figures—at the same time when\nother concerns (with better earnings growth of course) were selling\nfor billions of dollars in excess of what their balance sheets\nshowed? To quote the “old days” once more, the idea of good will\nas an element of intangible value was usually associated with a\n“trade name.” Names such as Lady Pepperell in sheets, Jantzen in\nswim suits, and Parker in pens would be considered assets of great\nvalue indeed. But now, if the “market doesn’t like a company,” not\nonly renowned trade names but land, buildings, machinery, and\nwhat you will, can all count for nothing in its scales. Pascal said\nthat “the heart has its reasons that the reason doesn’t under-\nstand.”* For “heart” read “Wall Street.”\nThere is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is\ngood and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no qual-\nity at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their\nprices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels\nin relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and\nPolaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with\nno overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable col-\nlapse in prices. (The SEC can’t do much more than insist on disclo-\nsure of information, about which the speculative public couldn’t\ncare less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive\nactions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly\nbroken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enter-\nprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophi-\ncally enough as “part of the game.” Everybody swears off such\ninexcusable extravagances—until next time.\nThanks for the lecture, says the gentle reader. But what about\nyour “bargain issues”? Can one really make money in them with-\nout taking a serious risk?

Sometimes the\npatience needed may appear quite considerable. In our previous\nedition we hazarded a single example (p. 188) which was current\nas we wrote. It was Burton-Dixie Corp., with stock selling at 20,\nagainst net-current-asset value of 30, and book value of about 50. A\nprofit on that purchase would not have been immediate. But in\nAugust 1967 all the shareholders were offered 533⁄ for their shares,\n4\nprobably at just about book value. A patient holder, who had\nbought the shares in March 1964 at 20 would have had a profit of\n165% in 31⁄ years—a noncompounded annual return of 47%. Most\n2\nof the bargain issues in our experience have not taken that long to\nshow good profits–nor have they shown so high a rate. For a some-\nwhat similar situation, current as we write, see our discussion of\nNational Presto Industries above, p. 168.\nSpecial Situations or “Workouts”\nLet us touch briefly on this area, since it is theoretically includ-\nable in the program of operations of an enterprising investor. It\nwas commented upon above. Here we shall supply some examples\nof the genre, and some further remarks on what it appears to offer\nan open-minded and alert investor.\nThree such situations, among others, were current early in 1971,\nand they may be summarized as follows:\nSituation1. Acquisition of Kayser-Roth by Borden’s. In January\n1971 Borden Inc. announced a plan to acquire control of Kayser-\nRoth (“diversified apparel”) by giving 11⁄ shares of its own stock in\n3\nexchange for one share of Kayser-Roth. On the following day, in\nactive trading. Borden closed at 26 and Kayser-Roth at 28. If an\n“operator” had bought 300 shares of Kayser-Roth and sold 400 Bor-\nden at these prices and if the deal were later consummated on the\nannounced terms, he would have had a profit of some 24% on the\ncost of his shares, less commissions and some other items. Assum-\ning the deal had gone through in six months, his final profit might\nhave been at about a 40% per annum rate.\nSituation 2. In November 1970 National Biscuit Co. offered to\nbuy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at $11 in cash. The stock was sell-\ning at about 81⁄; it closed the month at 9 and continued to sell there at\n2\nyear-end. Here the gross profit indicated was originally about 25%,\nsubjewctw tow th.ef xri1sk6s 1of8 n.ocnocomnsummation and to the time element.394 The Intelligent Investor\nSituation3. Universal-Marion Co., which had ceased its business\noperations, asked its shareholders to ratify dissolution of the concern.\nThe treasurer indicated that the common stock had a book value of\nabout $281⁄ per share, a substantial part of which was in liquid form.\n2\nThe stock closed 1970 at 211⁄, indicating a possible gross profit here, if\n2\nbook value was realized in liquidation, of more than 30%.\nIf operations of this kind, conducted on a diversified basis for\nspreading the risk, could be counted to yield annual profits of, say,\n20% or better, they would undoubtedly be more than merely\nworthwhile. Since this is not a book on “special situations,” we are\nnot going into the details of the business—for it really is a business.\nLet us point out two contradictory developments there in recent\nyears. On the one hand the number of deals to choose from has\nincreased enormously, as compared with, say, ten years ago. This is\na consequence of what might be called a mania of corporations to\ndiversify their activities through various types of acquisitions, etc.\nIn 1970 the number of “merger announcements” aggregated some\n5,000, down from over 6,000 in 1969. The total money values\ninvolved in these deals amounted to many, many billions. Perhaps\nonly a small fraction of the 5,000 announcements could have pre-\nsented a clear-cut opportunity for purchase of shares by a special-\nsituations man, but this fraction was still large enough to keep him\nbusy studying, picking, and choosing.\nThe other side of the picture is that an increasing proportion of\nthe mergers announced failed to be consummated. In such cases, of\ncourse, the aimed-for profit is not realized, and is likely to be\nreplaced by a more or less serious loss. Reasons for nonsuccess are\nnumerous, including antitrust intervention, shareholder opposi-\ntion, change in “market conditions,” unfavorable indications from\nfurther study, inability to agree on details, and others. The trick\nhere, of course, is to have the judgment, buttressed by experience,\nto pick the deals most likely to succeed and also those which are\nlikely to occasion the smallest loss if they fail.*\n*As discussed in the commentary on Chapter 7, merger arbitrage is wholly\ninappropriate for most individual investors.\nwww.fx1618.comStock Selection for the Enterprising Investor 395\nFurther Comment on the Examples Above\nKayser-Roth. The directors of this company had already\nrejected (in January 1971) the Borden proposal when this chapter\nwas written. If the operation had been “undone” immediately the\noverall loss, including commissions, would have been about 12%\nof the cost of the Kayser-Roth shares.\nAurora Plastics.Because of the bad showing of this company\nin 1970 the takeover terms were renegotiated and the price reduced\nto 101⁄. The shares were paid for at the end of May. The annual rate\n2\nof return realized here was about 25%.\nUniversal-Marion. This company promptly made an initial\ndistribution in cash and stock worth about $7 per share, reducing\nthe investment to say 141⁄. However the market price fell as low as\n2\n13 subsequently, casting doubt on the ultimate outcome of the liq-\nuidation.\nAssuming that the three examples given are fairly representa-\ntive of “workout or arbitrage” opportunities as a whole in 1971, it\nis clear that they are not attractive if entered into upon a random\nbasis. This has become more than ever a field for professionals,\nwith the requisite experience and judgment.\nThere is an interesting sidelight on our Kayser-Roth example.\nLate in 1971 the price fell below 20 while Borden was selling at 25,\nequivalent to 33 for Kayser-Roth under the terms of the exchange\noffer. It would appear that either the directors had made a great\nmistake in turning down that opportunity or the shares of Kayser-\nRoth were now badly undervalued in the market. Something for a\nsecurity analyst to look into.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 15\nIt is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy\nin solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in\nthe midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the inde-\npendence of solitude.\n—Ralph Waldo Emerson\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE\nMax Heine, founder of the Mutual Series Funds, liked to say that\n“there are many roads to Jerusalem.” What this masterly stock picker\nmeant was that his own value-centered method of selecting stocks\nwas not the only way to be a successful investor. In this chapter we’ll\nlook at several techniques that some of today’s leading money man-\nagers use for picking stocks.\nFirst, though, it’s worth repeating that for most investors, selecting\nindividual stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. The fact that most\nprofessionals do a poor job of stock picking does not mean that most\namateurs can do better. The vast majority of people who try to pick\nstocks learn that they are not as good at it as they thought; the lucki-\nest ones discover this early on, while the less fortunate take years to\nlearn it. A small percentage of investors can excel at picking their own\nstocks. Everyone else would be better off getting help, ideally through\nan index fund.\nGraham advised investors to practice first, just as even the greatest\nathletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual per-\nformance. He suggested starting off by spending a year tracking and\npicking stocks (but notwith real money).1In Graham’s day, you would\n1Patricia Dreyfus, “Investment Analysis in Two Easy Lessons” (interview\nwith Grawhamw),w M.ofnxe1y,6Ju1ly,8 1.9c76o, mp. 36.\n396Commentary on Chapter 15 397\nhave practiced using a ledger of hypothetical buys and sells on a\nlegal pad; nowadays, you can use “portfolio trackers” at websites like\nwww.morningstar.com, http://finance.yahoo.com, http://money.cnn.\ncom/services/portfolio/ or www.marketocracy.com (at the last site,\nignore the “market-beating” hype on its funds and other services).\nBy test-driving your techniques before trying them with real money,\nyou can make mistakes without incurring any actual losses, develop\nthe discipline to avoid frequent trading, compare your approach\nagainst those of leading money managers, and learn what works for\nyou. Best of all, tracking the outcome of all your stock picks will pre-\nvent you from forgetting that some of your hunches turn out to be\nstinkers. That will force you to learn from your winners andyour losers.\nAfter a year, measure your results against how you would have done if\nyou had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund. If you didn’t\nenjoy the experiment or your picks were poor, no harm done—selecting\nindividual stocks is not for you. Get yourself an index fund and stop\nwasting your time on stock picking.\nIf you enjoyed the experiment and earned sufficiently good returns,\ngradually assemble a basket of stocks—but limit it to a maximum of\n10% of your overall portfolio (keep the rest in an index fund). And\nremember, you can always stop if it no longer interests you or your\nreturns turn bad.\nLOOKING UNDER THE RIGHT ROCKS\nSo how should you go about looking for a potentially rewarding\nstock? You can use websites like http://finance.yahoo.com and\nwww.morningstar.com to screen stocks with the statistical filters sug-\ngested in Chapter 14. Or you can take a more patient, craftsmanlike\napproach. Unlike most people, many of the best professional investors\nfirst get interested in a company when its share price goes down, not\nup. Christopher Browne of Tweedy Browne Global Value Fund,\nWilliam Nygren of the Oakmark Fund, Robert Rodriguez of FPA Capi-\ntal Fund, and Robert Torray of the Torray Fund all suggest looking at\nthe daily list of new 52-week lows in the Wall Street Journal or the\nsimilar table in the “Market Week” section of Barron’s. That will point\nyou toward stocks and industries that are unfashionable or unloved\nand that thus offer the potential for high returns once perceptions\nchange.\nCwhriwstowph.fexr 1D6av1is8 o.fc tohem Davis Funds and William Miller of Legg398 Commentary on Chapter 15\nFROM EPS TO ROIC\nNet income or earnings per share (EPS) has been distorted in\nrecent years by factors like stock-option grants and accounting\ngains and charges. To see how much a company is truly earning\non the capital it deploys in its businesses, look beyond EPS to\nROIC, or return on invested capital. Christopher Davis of the\nDavis Funds defines it with this formula:\nROIC = Owner Earnings (cid:3)Invested Capital,\nwhere Owner Earnings is equal to:\nOperating profit\nplusdepreciation\nplusamortization of goodwill\nminusFederal income tax (paid at the company’s average rate)\nminuscost of stock options\nminus“maintenance” (or essential) capital expenditures\nminusany income generated by unsustainable rates of return on\npension funds (as of 2003, anything greater than 6.5%)\nand where Invested Capital is equal to:\nTotal assets\nminuscash (as well as short-term investments and non-interest-\nbearing current liabilities)\npluspast accounting charges that reduced invested capital.\nROIChas the virtue of showing, after all legitimate expenses,\nwhat the company earns from its operating businesses—and\nhow efficiently it has used the shareholders’ money to generate\nthat return. An ROIC of at least 10% is attractive; even 6% or\n7% can be tempting if the company has good brand names,\nfocused management, or is under a temporary cloud.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 15 399\nMason Value Trust like to see rising returns on invested capital, or\nROIC—a way of measuring how efficiently a company generates what\nWarren Buffett has called “owner earnings.”2 (See the sidebar on\np. 398 for more detail.)\nBy checking “comparables,” or the prices at which similar busi-\nnesses have been acquired over the years, managers like Oakmark’s\nNygren and Longleaf Partners’ O. Mason Hawkins get a better\nhandle on what a company’s parts are worth. For an individual\ninvestor, it’s painstaking and difficult work: Start by looking at the\n“Business Segments” footnote in the company’s annual report, which\ntypically lists the industrial sector, revenues, and earnings of each sub-\nsidiary. (The “Management Discussion and Analysis” may also be\nhelpful.) Then search a news database like Factiva, ProQuest, or\nLexisNexis for examples of other firms in the same industries that have\nrecently been acquired. Using the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov\nto locate their past annual reports, you may be able to determine the\nratio of purchase price to the earnings of those acquired companies.\nYou can then apply that ratio to estimate how much a corporate\nacquirer might pay for a similar division of the company you are inves-\ntigating.\nBy separately analyzing each of the company’s divisions this way,\nyou may be able to see whether they are worth more than the current\nstock price. Longleaf’s Hawkins likes to find what he calls “60-cent\ndollars,” or companies whose stock is trading at 60% or less of the\nvalue at which he appraises the businesses. That helps provide the\nmargin of safety that Graham insists on.\nWHO’S THE BOSS?\nFinally, most leading professional investors want to see that a com-\npany is run by people who, in the words of Oakmark’s William Nygren,\n“think like owners, not just managers.” Two simple tests: Are the\ncompany’s financial statements easily understandable, or are they full\nof obfuscation? Are “nonrecurring” or “extraordinary” or “unusual”\ncharges just that, or do they have a nasty habit of recurring?\nLongleaf’s Mason Hawkins looks for corporate managers who are\n2See the commentary on Chapter 11.\nwww.fx1618.com400 Commentary on Chapter 15\n“good partners”—meaning that they communicate candidly about\nproblems, have clear plans for allocating current and future cash flow,\nand own sizable stakes in the company’s stock (preferably through\ncash purchases rather than through grants of options). But “if man-\nagements talk more about the stock price than about the business,”\nwarns Robert Torray of the Torray Fund, “we’re not interested.”\nChristopher Davis of the Davis Funds favors firms that limit issuance\nof stock options to roughly 3% of shares outstanding.\nAt Vanguard Primecap Fund, Howard Schow tracks “what the com-\npany said one year and what happened the next. We want to see not\nonly whether managements are honest with shareholders but also\nwhether they’re honest with themselves.” (If a company boss insists\nthat all is hunky-dory when business is sputtering, watch out!) Nowa-\ndays, you can listen in on a company’s regularly scheduled conference\ncalls even if you own only a few shares; to find out the schedule, call\nthe investor relations department at corporate headquarters or visit\nthe company’s website.\nRobert Rodriguez of FPA Capital Fund turns to the back page of\nthe company’s annual report, where the heads of its operating divi-\nsions are listed. If there’s a lot of turnover in those names in the first\none or two years of a new CEO’s regime, that’s probably a good sign;\nhe’s cleaning out the dead wood. But if high turnover continues, the\nturnaround has probably devolved into turmoil.\nKEEPING YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD\nThere are even more roads to Jerusalem than these. Some leading\nportfolio managers, like David Dreman of Dreman Value Management\nand Martin Whitman of the Third Avenue Funds, focus on companies\nselling at very low multiples of assets, earnings, or cash flow. Others,\nlike Charles Royce of the Royce Funds and Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity\nLow-Priced Stock Fund, hunt for undervalued small companies. And,\nfor an all-too-brief look at how today’s most revered investor, Warren\nBuffett, selects companies, see the sidebar on p. 401.\nOne technique that can be helpful: See which leading professional\nmoney managers own the same stocks you do. If one or two names\nkeep turning up, go to the websites of those fund companies and\ndownload their most recent reports. By seeing which other stocks\nthese investors own, you can learn more about what qualities they\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 15 401\nWARREN’S WAY\nGraham’s greatest student, Warren Buffett, has become the\nworld’s most successful investor by putting new twists on\nGraham’s ideas. Buffett and his partner, Charles Munger, have\ncombined Graham’s “margin of safety” and detachment from\nthe market with their own innovative emphasis on future growth.\nHere is an all-too-brief summary of Buffett’s approach:\nHe looks for what he calls “franchise” companies with strong\nconsumer brands, easily understandable businesses, robust\nfinancial health, and near-monopolies in their markets, like H & R\nBlock, Gillette, and the Washington Post Co. Buffett likes to\nsnap up a stock when a scandal, big loss, or other bad news\npasses over it like a storm cloud—as when he bought Coca-Cola\nsoon after its disastrous rollout of “New Coke” and the market\ncrash of 1987. He also wants to see managers who set and\nmeet realistic goals; build their businesses from within rather\nthan through acquisition; allocate capital wisely; and do not pay\nthemselves hundred-million-dollar jackpots of stock options.\nBuffett insists on steady and sustainable growth in earnings, so\nthe company will be worth more in the future than it is today.\nIn his annual reports, archived at www.berkshirehathaway.\ncom, Buffett has set out his thinking like an open book. Probably\nno other investor, Graham included, has publicly revealed more\nabout his approach or written such compellingly readable\nessays. (One classic Buffett proverb: “When a management\nwith a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputa-\ntion for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that\nremains intact.”) Every intelligent investor can—and should—learn\nby reading this master’s own words.\nwww.fx1618.com402 Commentary on Chapter 15\nhave in common; by reading the managers’ commentary, you may get\nideas on how to improve your own approach.3\nNo matter which techniques they use in picking stocks, successful\ninvesting professionals have two things in common: First, they are dis-\nciplined and consistent, refusing to change their approach even when\nit is unfashionable. Second, they think a great deal about what they do\nand how to do it, but they pay very little attention to what the market is\ndoing.\n3There are also many newsletters dedicated to analyzing professional port-\nfolios, but most of them are a waste of time and money for even the most\nenterprising investor. A shining exception for people who can spare the\ncash is Outstanding Investor Digest(www.oid.com).\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 16\nConvertible Issues and Warrants\nC\nonvertible bonds and preferred stocks have been taking on a\npredominant importance in recent years in the field of senior\nfinancing. As a parallel development, stock-option warrants—\nwhich are long-term rights to buy common shares at stipulated\nprices—have become more and more numerous. More than half\nthe preferred issues now quoted in the Standard & Poor’s Stock\nGuide have conversion privileges, and this has been true also of a\nmajor part of the corporate bondfinancing in 1968–1970. There are\nat least 60 different series of stock-option warrants dealt in on the\nAmerican Stock Exchange. In 1970, for the first time in its history,\nthe New York Stock Exchange listed an issue of long-term war-\nrants, giving rights to buy 31,400,000 American Tel. & Tel. shares at\n$52 each. With “Mother Bell” now leading that procession, it is\nbound to be augmented by many new fabricators of warrants. (As\nwe shall point out later, they are a fabrication in more than one\nsense.)*\nIn the overall picture the convertible issues rank as much more\nimportant than the warrants, and we shall discuss them first. There\nare two main aspects to be considered from the standpoint of the\ninvestor. First, how do they rank as investment opportunities and\nrisks? Second, how does their existence affect the value of the\nrelated common-stock issues?\nConvertible issues are claimed to be especially advantageous to\nboth the investor and the issuing corporation. The investor receives\nthe superior protection of a bond or preferred stock, plus the\nopportunity to participate in any substantial rise in the value of the\n*Graham detested warrants, as he makes clear on pp. 413–416.\nwww.fx1618.com\n403404 The Intelligent Investor\ncommon stock. The issuer is able to raise capital at a moderate\ninterest or preferred dividend cost, and if the expected prosperity\nmaterializes the issuer will get rid of the senior obligation by hav-\ning it exchanged into common stock. Thus both sides to the bargain\nwill fare unusually well.\nObviously the foregoing paragraph must overstate the case\nsomewhere, for you cannot by a mere ingenious device make a bar-\ngain much better for both sides. In exchange for the conversion\nprivilege the investor usually gives up something important in\nquality or yield, or both.1 Conversely, if the company gets its\nmoney at lower cost because of the conversion feature, it is surren-\ndering in return part of the common shareholders’ claim to future\nenhancement. On this subject there are a number of tricky argu-\nments to be advanced both pro and con. The safest conclusion that\ncan be reached is that convertible issues are like any other form of\nsecurity, in that their form itself guarantees neither attractiveness\nnor unattractiveness. That question will depend on all the facts\nsurrounding the individual issue.*\nWe do know, however, that the group of convertible issues\nfloated during the latter part of a bull market are bound to yield\nunsatisfactory results as a whole. (It is at such optimistic periods,\nunfortunately, that most of the convertible financing has been done\nin the past.) The poor consequences must be inevitable, from the\ntiming itself, since a wide decline in the stock market must invari-\nably make the conversion privilege much less attractive—and\noften, also, call into question the underlying safety of the issue\nitself.† As a group illustration we shall retain the example used in\n*Graham is pointing out that, despite the promotional rhetoric that investors\nusually hear, convertible bonds do not automatically offer “the best of both\nworlds.” Higher yield and lower risk do not always go hand in hand. What\nWall Street gives with one hand, it usually takes away with the other. An\ninvestment may offer the best of one world, or the worst of another; but the\nbest of both worlds seldom becomes available in a single package.\n†According to Goldman Sachs and Ibbotson Associates, from 1998\nthrough 2002, convertibles generated an average annual return of 4.8%.\nThat was considerably better than the 0.6% annual loss on U.S. stocks, but\nsubstantially worse than the returns of medium-term corporate bonds (a\nwww.fx1618.comConvertible Issues and Warrants 405\nTABLE 16-1 Price Record of New Preferred-Stock Issues\nOffered in 1946\nConvertible and\n“Straight” Participating\nPrice Change from Issue Price Issues Issues\nto Low up to July 1947 (number of issues)\nNo decline 7 0\nDeclined 0–10% 16 2\n10–20% 11 6\n20–40% 3 22\n40% or more 0 12\n37 42\nAverage decline About 9% About 30%\nour first edition of the relative price behavior of convertible and\nstraight (nonconvertible) preferreds offered in 1946, the closing\nyear of the bull market preceding the extraordinary one that began\nin 1949.\nA comparable presentation is difficult to make for the years\n1967–1970, because there were virtually no new offerings of non-\nconvertibles in those years. But it is easy to demonstrate that the\naverage price decline of convertible preferred stocks from Decem-\nber 1967 to December 1970 was greater than that for common\nstocks as a whole (which lost only 5%). Also the convertibles seem\nto have done quite a bit worse than the older straight preferred\nshares during the period December 1968 to December 1970, as is\nshown by the sample of 20 issues of each kind in Table 16-2.

In 2000, $58 billion in convertibles were issued, and in 2001,\nanother $105 billion emerged. As Graham warns, convertible securities\nalways come out of the woodwork near the end of a bull market—largely\nbecause even poor-quality companies then have stock returns high enough\nto make the conversion feature seem attractive.\nwww.fx1618.com406 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 16-2 Price Record of Preferred Stocks, Common Stocks,\nand Warrants, December 1970 versus December 1968\n(Based on Random Samples of 20 Issues Each)\nStraight Preferred Stocks Convertible Listed\nRated A Rated Preferred Common Listed\nor Better Below A Stocks Stocks Warrants\nAdvances 2 0 1 2 1\nDeclines:\n0–10% 3 3 3 4 0\n10–20% 14 10 2 1 0\n20–40% 1 5 5 6 1\n40% or more 0 0 9 7 18\nAverage declines 10% 17% 29% 33% 65%\n(Standard & Poor’s composite index of 500 common stocks declined 11.3%.)\ncomparisons would demonstrate that convertible securities as a\nwhole have relatively poor quality as senior issues and also are tied\nto common stocks that do worse than the general market except\nduring a speculative upsurge. These observations do not apply to\nall convertible issues, of course. In the 1968 and 1969 particularly, a\nfair number of strong companies used convertible issues to combat\nthe inordinately high interest rates for even first-quality bonds. But\nit is noteworthy that in our 20-stock sample of convertible pre-\nferreds only one showed an advance and 14 suffered bad declines.*\n*Recent structural changes in the convertible market have negated some of\nthese criticisms. Convertible preferred stock, which made up roughly half\nthe total convertible market in Graham’s day, now accounts for only an\neighth of the market. Maturities are shorter, making convertible bonds less\nvolatile, and many now carry “call protection,” or assurances against early\nredemption. And more than half of all convertibles are now investment\ngrade, a significant improvement in credit quality from Graham’s time. Thus,\nin 2002, the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertible Index lost 8.6%—versus the\n22.1% loss of the S & P 500-stock index and the 31.3% decline in the\nNASDAQw Cwomwp.ofsxite1 s6to1ck8 i.ncdeox.mConvertible Issues and Warrants 407\nThe conclusion to be drawn from these figures is not that con-\nvertible issues are in themselves less desirable than nonconvertible\nor “straight” securities. Other things being equal, the opposite is\ntrue. But we clearly see that other things are not equal in practice\nand that the addition of the conversion privilege often—perhaps\ngenerally—betrays an absence of genuine investment quality for\nthe issue.\nIt is true, of course, that a convertible preferred is safer than the\ncommon stock of the same company—that is to say, it carries\nsmaller risk of eventual loss of principal. Consequently those who\nbuy new convertibles instead of the corresponding common stock\nare logical to that extent. But in most cases the common would not\nhave been an intelligent purchase to begin with, at the ruling price,\nand the substitution of the convertible preferred did not improve\nthe picture sufficiently. Furthermore, a good deal of the buying of\nconvertibles was done by investors who had no special interest or\nconfidence in the common stock—that is, they would never have\nthought of buying the common at the time—but who were\ntempted by what seemed an ideal combination of a prior claim\nplus a conversion privilege close to the current market. In a num-\nber of instances this combination has worked out well, but the sta-\ntistics seem to show that it is more likely to prove a pitfall.\nIn connection with the ownership of convertibles there is a spe-\ncial problem which most investors fail to realize. Even when a\nprofit appears it brings a dilemma with it. Should the holder sell on\na small rise; should he hold for a much bigger advance; if the issue\nis called—as often happens when the common has gone up consid-\nerably—should he sell out then or convert into and retain the com-\nmon stock?*\nLet us talk in concrete terms. You buy a 6% bond at 100, convert-\nible into stock at 25—that is, at the rate of 40 shares for each $1,000\nbond. The stock goes to 30, which makes the bond worth at least\n120, and so it sells at 125. You either sell or hold. If you hold, hop-\ning for a higher price, you are pretty much in the position of a com-\n*Abond is “called” when the issuing corporation forcibly pays it off ahead\nof the stated maturity date, or final due date for interest payments.

Aconservative person is likely to say that beyond 125\nhis position has become too speculative, and therefore he sells and\nmakes a gratifying 25% profit.\nSo far, so good. But pursue the matter a bit. In many cases where\nthe holder sells at 125 the common stock continues to advance, car-\nrying the convertible with it, and the investor experiences that\npeculiar pain that comes to the man who has sold out much too\nsoon. The next time, he decides to hold for 150 or 200. The issue\ngoes up to 140 and he does not sell. Then the market breaks and his\nbond slides down to 80. Again he has done the wrong thing.\nAside from the mental anguish involved in making these bad\nguesses—and they seem to be almost inevitable—there is a real\narithmetical drawback to operations in convertible issues. It may\nbe assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or\n30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings. This\nwould then mark the upper limit of profit and would be realized\nonly on the issues that worked out well. But, if—as appears to be\ntrue—these issues often lack adequate underlying security and\ntend to be floated and purchased in the latter stages of a bull mar-\nket, then a goodly proportion of them will fail to rise to 125 but will\nnot fail to collapse when the market turns downward. Thus the\nspectacular opportunities in convertibles prove to be illusory in\npractice, and the overall experience is marked by fully as many\nsubstantial losses—at least of a temporary kind—as there are gains\nof similar magnitude.\nBecause of the extraordinary length of the 1950–1968 bull market,\nconvertible issues as a whole gave a good account of themselves for\nsome 18 years. But this meant only that the great majority of common\nstocks enjoyed large advances, in which most convertible issues were\nable to share. The soundness of investment in convertible issues can\nonly be tested by their performance in a declining stock market—and\nthis has always proved disappointing as a whole.*\nIn our first edition (1949) we gave an illustration of this special\n*In recent years, convertibles have tended to outperform the Standard &\nPoor’s 500-stock index during declining stock markets, but they have typi-\ncally underperformed other bonds—which weakens, but does not fully\nnegate, twhew criwtic.isfmx 1G6ra1ha8m. mcaokmes here.Convertible Issues and Warrants 409\nproblem of “what to do” with a convertible when it goes up. We\nbelieve it still merits inclusion here. Like several of our references it\nis based on our own investment operations. We were members of a\n“select group,” mainly of investment funds, who participated in a\nprivate offering of convertible 41⁄% debentures of Eversharp Co. at\n2\npar, convertible into common stock at $40 per share. The stock\nadvanced rapidly to 651⁄, and then (after a three-for-two split) to the\n2\nequivalent of 88. The latter price made the convertible debentures\nworth no less than 220. During this period the two issues were\ncalled at a small premium; hence they were practically all converted\ninto common stock, which was retained by a number of the original\ninvestment-fund buyers of the debentures. The price promptly\nbegan a severe decline, and in March 1948 the stock sold as low as\n73⁄. This represented a value of only 27 for the debenture issues, or a\n8\nloss of 75% of the original price instead of a profit of over 100%.\nThe real point of this story is that some of the original purchasers\nconverted their bonds into the stock and held the stock through its\ngreat decline. In so doing they ran counter to an old maxim of Wall\nStreet, which runs: “Never convert a convertible bond.” Why this\nadvice? Because once you convert you have lost your strategic com-\nbination of prior claimant to interest plus a chance for an attractive\nprofit. You have probably turned from investor into speculator, and\nquite often at an unpropitious time (because the stock has already\nhad a large advance). If “Never convert a convertible” is a good\nrule, how came it that these experienced fund managers exchanged\ntheir Eversharp bonds for stock, to their subsequent embarrassing\nloss? The answer, no doubt, is that they let themselves be carried\naway by enthusiasm for the company’s prospects as well as by the\n“favorable market action” of the shares. Wall Street has a few pru-\ndent principles; the trouble is that they are always forgotten when\nthey are most needed.* Hence that other famous dictum of the old-\ntimers: “Do as I say, not as I do.”\nOur general attitude toward new convertible issues is thus a\nmistrustful one. We mean here, as in other similar observations,\n*This sentence could serve as the epitaph for the bull market of the 1990s.\nAmong the “few prudent principles” that investors forgot were such market\nclichés as “Trees don’t grow to the sky” and “Bulls make money, bears make\nmonewy, wbuwt p.igfsx g1e6t s1la8ug.hcteoremd.”410 The Intelligent Investor\nthat the investor should look more than twice before he buys them.\nAfter such hostile scrutiny he may find some exceptional offerings\nthat are too good to refuse. The ideal combination, of course, is a\nstrongly secured convertible, exchangeable for a common stock\nwhich itself is attractive, and at a price only slightly higher than the\ncurrent market. Every now and then a new offering appears that\nmeets these requirements. By the nature of the securities markets,\nhowever, you are more likely to find such an opportunity in some\nolder issue which has developed into a favorable position rather\nthan in a new flotation. (If a new issue is a really strong one, it is\nnot likely to have a good conversion privilege.)\nThe fine balance between what is given and what is withheld in\na standard-type convertible issue is well illustrated by the exten-\nsive use of this type of security in the financing of American Tele-\nphone & Telegraph Company. Between 1913 and 1957 the company\nsold at least nine separate issues of convertible bonds, most of\nthem through subscription rights to shareholders. The convertible\nbonds had the important advantage to the company of bringing in\na much wider class of buyers than would have been available for a\nstock offering, since the bonds were popular with many financial\ninstitutions which possess huge resources but some of which were\nnot permitted to buy stocks. The interest return on the bonds has\ngenerally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on\nthe stock—a factor that was calculated to offset the prior claim of\nthe bondholders. Since the company maintained its $9 dividend\nrate for 40 years (from 1919 to the stock split in 1959) the result was\nthe eventual conversion of virtually all the convertible issues into\ncommon stock. Thus the buyers of these convertibles have fared\nwell through the years—but not quite so well as if they had bought\nthe capital stock in the first place. This example establishes the\nsoundness of American Telephone & Telegraph, but not the intrin-\nsic attractiveness of convertible bonds. To prove them sound in\npractice we should need to have a number of instances in which\nthe convertible worked out well even though the common stock\nproved disappointing. Such instances are not easy to find.*\n*AT&T Corp. no longer is a significant issuer of convertible bonds. Among\nthe largest issuers of convertibles today are General Motors, Merrill Lynch,\nTyco Intewrnawtiowna.l,f xan1d 6R1oc8he..comConvertible Issues and Warrants 411\nEffect of Convertible Issues on the Status of\nthe Common Stock\nIn a large number of cases convertibles have been issued in con-\nnection with mergers or new acquisitions. Perhaps the most strik-\ning example of this financial operation was the issuance by the\nNVF Corp. of nearly $100,000,000 of its 5% convertible bonds (plus\nwarrants) in exchange for most of the common stock of Sharon\nSteel Co. This extraordinary deal is discussed below pp. 429–433.\nTypically the transaction results in a pro forma increase in the\nreported earnings per share of common stock; the shares advance\nin response to their larger earnings, so-called, but also because the\nmanagement has given evidence of its energy, enterprise, and abil-\nity to make more money for the shareholders.* But there are two\noffsetting factors, one of which is practically ignored and the other\nentirely so in optimistic markets. The first is the actual dilution of\nthe current and future earnings on the common stock that flows\narithmetically from the new conversion rights. This dilution can be\nquantified by taking the recent earnings, or assuming some other\nfigures, and calculating the adjusted earnings per share if all the\nconvertible shares or bonds were actually converted. In the major-\nity of companies the resulting reduction in per-share figures is not\nsignificant. But there are numerous exceptions to this statement,\nand there is danger that they will grow at an uncomfortable rate.\nThe fast-expanding “conglomerates” have been the chief practi-\ntioners of convertible legerdemain.

The reverse is generally true at present. As a result there\nare a considerable number of convertible preferred stocks which\nare clearly more attractive than the related common shares. Own-\ners of the common have nothing to lose and important advantages\nto gain by switching from their junior shares into the senior issue.\nExample: A typical example was presented by Studebaker-\nWorthington Corp. at the close of 1970.

Each preferred\n2\nshare is exchangeable for 11⁄ shares of common, then worth 851⁄.\n2 2\nThis would indicate a small money difference against the buyer of\nthe preferred. But dividends are being paid on the common at the\nannual rate of $1.20 (or $1.80 for the 11⁄ shares), against the $5\n2\nobtainable on one share of preferred. Thus the original adverse dif-\nference in price would probably be made up in less than a year,\nafter which the preferred would probably return an appreciably\nhigher dividend yield than the common for some time to come. But\nmost important, of course, would be the senior position that the\ncommon shareholder would gain from the switch. At the lowprices\nwww.fx1618.comConvertible Issues and Warrants 413\nof 1968 and again in 1970 the preferred sold 15 points higher than\n11⁄ shares of common. Its conversion privilege guarantees that it\n2\ncould never sell lower than the common package.2\nStock-Option Warrants\nLet us mince no words at the outset. We consider the recent\ndevelopment of stock-option warrants as a near fraud, an existing\nmenace, and a potential disaster. They have created huge aggregate\ndollar “values” out of thin air. They have no excuse for existence\nexcept to the extent that they mislead speculators and investors.\nThey should be prohibited by law, or at least strictly limited to a\nminor part of the total capitalization of a company.*\nFor an analogy in general history and in literature we refer the\nreader to the section of Faust (part 2), in which Goethe describes\nthe invention of paper money. As an ominous precedent on Wall\nStreet history, we may mention the warrants of American & For-\neign Power Co., which in 1929 had a quoted market value of over a\nbillion dollars, although they appeared only in a footnote to the\ncompany’s balance sheet. By 1932 this billion dollars had shrunk to\n$8 million, and in 1952 the warrants were wiped out in the\ncompany’s recapitalization—even though it had remained solvent.\nOriginally, stock-option warrants were attached now and then\nto bond issues, and were usually equivalent to a partial conversion\nprivilege. They were unimportant in amount, and hence did no\nharm. Their use expanded in the late 1920s, along with many other\nfinancial abuses, but they dropped from sight for long years there-\nafter. They were bound to turn up again, like the bad pennies they\nare, and since 1967 they have become familiar “instruments of\n*Warrants were an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in\nthe nineteenth century and were fairly common even in Graham’s day. They\nhave since diminished in importance and popularity—one of the few recent\ndevelopments that would give Graham unreserved pleasure. As of year-end\n2002, there were only seven remaining warrant issues on the New York\nStock Exchange—only the ghostly vestige of a market. Because warrants are\nno longer commonly used by major companies, today’s investors should\nread the rest of Graham’s chapter only to see how his logic works.\nwww.fx1618.com414 The Intelligent Investor\nfinance.” In fact a standard procedure has developed for raising\nthe capital for new real-estate ventures, affiliates of large banks, by\nselling units of an equal number of common shares and warrants\nto buy additional common shares at the same price. Example: In\n1971 CleveTrust Realty Investors sold 2,500,000 of these combina-\ntions of common stock (or “shares of beneficial interest”) and war-\nrants, for $20 per unit.\nLet us consider for a moment what is really involved in this\nfinancial setup. Ordinarily, a common-stock issue has the first right\nto buy additional common shares when the company’s directors\nfind it desirable to raise capital in this manner. This so-called “pre-\nemptive right” is one of the elements of value entering into the\nownership of common stock—along with the right to receive divi-\ndends, to participate in the company’s growth, and to vote for\ndirectors. When separate warrants are issued for the right to sub-\nscribe additional capital, that action takes away part of the value\ninherent in an ordinary common share and transfers it to a separate\ncertificate. An analogous thing could be done by issuing separate\ncertificates for the right to receive dividends (for a limited or\nunlimited period), or the right to share in the proceeds of sale or\nliquidation of the enterprise, or the right to vote the shares. Why\nthen are these subscription warrants created as part of the original\ncapital structure? Simply because people are inexpert in financial\nmatters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth less\nwith warrants outstanding than otherwise. Hence the package of\nstock and warrants usually commands a better price in the market\nthan would the stock alone. Note that in the usual company reports\nthe per-share earnings are (or have been) computed without\nproper allowance for the effect of outstanding warrants. The result\nis, of course, to overstate the true relationship between the earnings\nand the market value of the company’s capitalization.*\n*Today, the last remnant of activity in warrants is in the cesspool of the\nNASDAQ “bulletin board,” or over-the-counter market for tiny companies,\nwhere common stock is often bundled with warrants into a “unit” (the con-\ntemporary equivalent of what Graham calls a “package”). If a stockbroker\never offers to sell you “units” in any company, you can be 95% certain that\nwarrants are involved, and at least 90% certain that the broker is either a\nthief or awn idwiowt. L.efxgi1tim6a1te 8br.ockoerms and firms have no business in this area.Convertible Issues and Warrants 415\nThe simplest and probably the best method of allowing for the\nexistence of warrants is to add the equivalent of their market value\nto the common-share capitalization, thus increasing the “true”\nmarket price per share. Where large amounts of warrants have\nbeen issued in connection with the sale of senior securities, it is\ncustomary to make the adjustment by assuming that the proceeds\nof the stock payment are used to retire the related bonds or pre-\nferred shares. This method does not allow adequately for the usual\n“premium value” of a warrant above exercisable value. In Table\n16-4 we compare the effect of the two methods of calculation in the\ncase of National General Corp. for the year 1970.\nDoes the company itself derive an advantage from the creation\nof these warrants, in the sense that they assure it in some way of\nreceiving additional capital when it needs some? Not at all. Ordi-\nnarily there is no way in which the company can require the war-\nrant-holders to exercise their rights, and thus provide new capital\nto the company, prior to the expiration date of the warrants. In the\nmeantime, if the company wants to raise additional common-stock\nfunds it must offer the shares to its shareholders in the usual way—\nwhich means somewhat under the ruling market price. The war-\nrants are no help in such an operation; they merely complicate the\nsituation by frequently requiring a downward revision in their\nown subscription price. Once more we assert that large issues of\nstock-option warrants serve no purpose, except to fabricate imagi-\nnary market values.\nThe paper money that Goethe was familiar with, when he wrote\nhis Faust, were the notorious French assignats that had been\ngreeted as a marvelous invention, and were destined ultimately to\nlose all of their value—as did the billion dollars worth of American\n& Foreign Power warrants.* Some of the poet’s remarks apply\n*The “notorious French assignats” were issued during the Revolution of\n1789.

Nearly all the newer warrants run for a limited\ntime—generally between five and ten years. The older warrants\nwere often perpetual, and they were likely to have fascinating price\nhistories over the years.\nExample: The record books will show that Tri-Continental Corp.\nwarrants, which date from 1929, sold at a negligible 1/32 of a dol-\nlar each in the depth of the depression. From that lowly estate their\nprice rose to a magnificent 753⁄ in 1969, an astronomical advance of\n4\nsome 242,000%. (The warrants then sold considerably higher than\nthe shares themselves; this is the kind of thing that occurs on Wall\nStreet through technical developments, such as stock splits.) A\nrecent example is supplied by Ling-Temco-Vought warrants, which\nin the first half of 1971 advanced from 21⁄ to 121⁄—and then fell\n2 2\nback to 4.\nNo doubt shrewd operations can be carried on in warrants from\ntime to time, but this is too technical a matter for discussion here.\nWe might say that warrants tend to sell relatively higher than the\ncorresponding market components related to the conversion privi-\nlege of bonds or preferred stocks. To that extent there is a valid\nargument for selling bonds with warrants attached rather than cre-\nating an equivalent dilution factor by a convertible issue. If the\nwarrant total is relatively small there is no point in taking its theo-\nretical aspect too seriously; if the warrant issue is large relative to\nthe outstanding stock, that would probably indicate that the com-\npany has a top-heavy senior capitalization. It should be selling\nadditional common stock instead. Thus the main objective of our\nattack on warrants as a financial mechanism is not to condemn\ntheir use in connection with moderate-size bond issues, but to\nargue against the wanton creation of huge “paper-money” mon-\nstrosities of this genre.\n*Graham, an enthusiastic reader of Spanish literature, is paraphrasing a line\nfrom the play Life Is a Dreamby Pedro Calderon de la Barca (1600–1681):\n“The greatest crime of man is having been born.”\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 16\nThat which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.\n—I. Corinthians, XV:36.\nTHE ZEAL OF THE CONVERT\nAlthough convertible bonds are called “bonds,” they behave like\nstocks, work like options, and are cloaked in obscurity.\nIf you own a convertible, you also hold an option: You can either\nkeep the bond and continue to earn interest on it, or you can\nexchange it for common stock of the issuing company at a predeter-\nmined ratio. (An option gives its owner the right to buy or sell another\nsecurity at a given price within a specific period of time.) Because they\nare exchangeable into stock, convertibles pay lower rates of interest\nthan most comparable bonds. On the other hand, if a company’s stock\nprice soars, a convertible bond exchangeable into that stock will per-\nform much better than a conventional bond. (Conversely, the typical\nconvertible—with its lower interest rate—will fare worse in a falling\nbond market.)1\n1As a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice, consider the\n4.75% convertible subordinated notes issued by DoubleClick Inc. in 1999.\nThey pay $47.50 in interest per year and are each convertible into 24.24\nshares of the company’s common stock, a “conversion ratio” of 24.24. As of\nyear-end 2002, DoubleClick’s stock was priced at $5.66 a share, giving\neach bond a “conversion value” of $137.20 ($5.66 (cid:1)24.24). Yet the bonds\ntraded roughly six times higher, at $881.30—creating a “conversion pre-\nmium,” or excess over their conversion value, of 542%. If you bought at that\nprice, your “break-even time,” or “payback period,” was very long. (You paid\nroughly $750 more than the conversion value of the bond, so it will take\nnearly 16w yewarws o.ff $x417.6501 i8nt.ecreostm payments for you to “earn back” that con-\n418Commentary on Chapter 16 419\nFrom 1957 through 2002, according to Ibbotson Associates, con-\nvertible bonds earned an annual average return of 8.3%—only two per-\ncentage points below the total return on stocks, but with steadier\nprices and shallower losses.2 More income, less risk than stocks: No\nwonder Wall Street’s salespeople often describe convertibles as a\n“best of both worlds” investment. But the intelligent investor will\nquickly realize that convertibles offer less income and more risk than\nmost other bonds. So they could, by the same logic and with equal\njustice, be called a “worst of both worlds” investment. Which side you\ncome down on depends on how you use them.\nIn truth, convertibles act more like stocks than bonds. The return on\nconvertibles is about 83% correlated to the Standard & Poor’s 500-\nstock index—but only about 30% correlated to the performance of\nTreasury bonds. Thus, “converts” zig when most bonds zag. For con-\nservative investors with most or all of their assets in bonds, adding a\ndiversified bundle of converts is a sensible way to seek stock-like\nreturns without having to take the scary step of investing in stocks\ndirectly. You could call convertible bonds “stocks for chickens.”\nAs convertibles expert F. Barry Nelson of Advent Capital Manage-\nment points out, this roughly $200 billion market has blossomed since\nGraham’s day. Most converts are now medium-term, in the seven-to-\n10-year range; roughly half are investment-grade; and many issues\nnow carry some call protection (an assurance against early redemp-\ntion). All these factors make them less risky than they used to be.3\nversion premium.) Since each DoubleClick bond is convertible to just over\n24 common shares, the stock will have to rise from $5.66 to more than $36\nif conversion is to become a practical option before the bonds mature in\n2006. Such a stock return is not impossible, but it borders on the miracu-\nlous. The cash yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate, given\nthe low probability of conversion.\n2Like many of the track records commonly cited on Wall Street, this one is\nhypothetical. It indicates the return you would have earned in an imagin-\nary index fund that owned all major convertibles. It does not include any\nmanagement fees or trading costs (which are substantial for convertible\nsecurities). In the real world, your returns would have been roughly two per-\ncentage points lower.\n3However, most convertible bonds remain junior to other long-term debt\nand bwanwk wloa.nfsx—1so6, 1in 8a .bcaonkmruptcy, convertible holders do not have prior420 Commentary on Chapter 16\nIt’s expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds, and diversifi-\ncation is impractical unless you have well over $100,000 to invest in\nthis sector alone. Fortunately, today’s intelligent investor has the con-\nvenient recourse of buying a low-cost convertible bond fund. Fidelity\nand Vanguard offer mutual funds with annual expenses comfortably\nunder 1%, while several closed-end funds are also available at a rea-\nsonable cost (and, occasionally, at discounts to net asset value).4\nOn Wall Street, cuteness and complexity go hand-in-hand—and\nconvertibles are no exception. Among the newer varieties are a jumble\nof securities with acronymic nicknames like LYONS, ELKS, EYES,\nPERCS, MIPS, CHIPS, and YEELDS. These intricate securities put a\n“floor” under your potential losses, but also cap your potential profits\nand often compel you to convert into common stock on a fixed date.\nLike most investments that purport to ensure against loss (see sidebar\non p. 421), these things are generally more trouble than they are\nworth.

(A recent Google search\non “covered call writing” turned up more than 2,600 hits.) What\nare covered calls, and how do they work? Imagine that you buy\n100 shares of Ixnay Corp. at $95 apiece. You then sell (or\n“write”) a call option on your shares. In exchange, you get a\ncash payment known as a “call premium.” (Let’s say it’s $10 per\nshare.) The buyer of the option, meanwhile, has the contractual\nright to buy your Ixnay shares at a mutually agreed-upon price—\nsay, $100. You get to keep the stock so long as it stays below\n$100, and you earn a fat $1,000 in premium income, which will\ncushion the fall if Ixnay’s stock crashes.\nLess risk, more income. What’s not to like?\nWell, now imagine that Ixnay’s stock price jumps overnight to\n$110. Then your option buyer will exercise his rights, yanking\nyour shares away for $100 apiece. You’ve still got your $1,000\nin income, but he’s got your Ixnay—and the more it goes up, the\nharder you will kick yourself.1\nSince the potential gain on a stock is unlimited, while no loss\ncan exceed 100%, the only person you will enrich with this strat-\negy is your broker. You’ve put a floor under your losses, but\nyou’ve also slapped a ceiling over your gains. For individual\ninvestors, covering your downside is never worth surrendering\nmost of your upside.\n1Alternatively, you could buy back the call option, but you would have to take\na loss on it—and options can have even higher trading costs than stocks.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 17\nFour Extremely Instructive Case Histories\nT\nhe word “extremely” in the title is a kind of pun, because the his-\ntories represent extremes of various sorts that were manifest on\nWall Street in recent years.

Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the financial world. It has\ndefaulted on most of its bond issues, and has been in danger of\nabandoning its operations entirely. Its security issues fell drasti-\ncally in price, the common stock collapsing from a high level of 861⁄\n2\nas recently as 1968 to a low of 51⁄ in 1970. (There seems little doubt\n2\nthat these shares will be wiped out in reorganization.)*\nOur basic point is that the application of the simplest rules of\nsecurity analysis and the simplest standards of sound investment\nwould have revealed the fundamental weakness of the Penn Cen-\ntral system long before its bankruptcy—certainly in 1968, when the\nshares were selling at their post-1929 record, and when most of its\nbond issues could have been exchanged at even prices for well-\nsecured public-utility obligations with the same coupon rates. The\nfollowing comments are in order:\n1. In the S & PBond Guidethe interest charges of the system are\nshown to have been earned 1.91 times in 1967 and 1.98 times in\n1968. The minimum coverage prescribed for railroad bonds in our\ntextbook Security Analysis is 5 times before income taxes and 2.9\ntimes after income taxes at regular rates. As far as we know the\nvalidity of these standards has never been questioned by any\ninvestment authority. On the basis of our requirements for earnings\nafter taxes,the Penn Central fell short of the requirements for safety.\nBut our after-tax requirement is based on a before-tax ratio of five\ntimes, with regular income tax deducted after the bond interest. In\nthe case of Penn Central, it had been paying no income taxes to speak\nof for the past 11 years! Hence the coverage of its interest charges\nbefore taxes was less than two times—a totally inadequate figure\nagainst our conservative requirement of 5 times.\n*How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s bankruptcy,\nwhich was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The closing trade\nin Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was $11.25 per share—hardly a\ngoing-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks like Enron and\nWorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly before filing for\nbankrwupwtcyw p.rofxte1ct6ion1.8.com424 The Intelligent Investor\n2. The fact that the company paid no income taxes over so long a\nperiod should have raised serious questions about the validityof its\nreported earnings.\n3. The bonds of the Penn Central system could have been\nexchanged in 1968 and 1969, at no sacrifice of price or income, for\nfar better secured issues. For example, in 1969, Pennsylvania RR\n41⁄s, due 1994 (part of Penn Central) had a range of 61 to 741⁄, while\n2 2\nPennsylvania Electric Co. 43⁄s, due 1994, had a range of 641⁄ to 721⁄.\n8 4 4\nThe public utility had earned its interest 4.20 times before taxes in\n1968 against only 1.98 times for the Penn Central system; during\n1969 the latter’s comparative showing grew steadily worse. An\nexchange of this sort was clearly called for, and it would have been\na lifesaver for a Penn Central bondholder. (At the end of 1970 the\nrailroad 41⁄s were in default, and selling at only 181⁄, while the\n4 2\nutility’s 43⁄s closed at 661⁄.)\n8 2\n4. Penn Central reported earnings of $3.80 per share in 1968; its\nhigh price of 861⁄ in that year was 24 times such earnings. But any\n2\nanalyst worth his salt would have wondered how “real” were\nearnings of this sort reported without the necessity of paying any\nincome taxes thereon.\n5. For 1966 the newly merged company* had reported “earn-\nings” of $6.80 a share—in reflection of which the common stock\nlater rose to its peak of 861⁄. This was a valuation of over $2 billion\n2\nfor the equity. How many of these buyers knew at the time that the\nso lovely earnings were before a special charge of $275 million or\n$12 per share to be taken in 1971 for “costs and losses” incurred on\nthe merger. O wondrous fairyland of Wall Street where a company\ncan announce “profits” of $6.80 per share in one place and special\n“costs and losses” of $12 in another, and shareholders and specula-\ntors rub their hands with glee!†\n*Penn Central was the product of the merger, announced in 1966, of the\nPennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad.\n†This kind of accounting legerdemain, in which profits are reported as if\n“unusual” or “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” charges do not matter, antici-\npates the reliance on “pro forma” financial statements that became popular\nin the latew 1w99w0s. f(sxe1e 6th1e 8co.mcmoemntary on Chapter 12).Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories 425\n6. A railroad analyst would have long since known that the\noperating picture of the Penn Central was very bad in comparison\nwith the more profitable roads. For example, its transportation\nratio was 47.5% in 1968 against 35.2% for its neighbor, Norfolk &\nWestern.*\n7. Along the way there were some strange transactions with\npeculiar accounting results.1Details are too complicated to go into\nhere.\nConclusion: Whether better management could have saved the\nPenn Central bankruptcy may be arguable. But there is no doubt\nwhatever that no bonds and no shares of the Penn Central system\nshould have remained after 1968 at the latest in any securities\naccount watched over by competent security analysts, fund man-\nagers, trust officers, or investment counsel. Moral:Security analysts\nshould do their elementary jobs before they study stock-market\nmovements, gaze into crystal balls, make elaborate mathematical\ncalculations, or go on all-expense-paid field trips.†\nLing-Temco-Vought Inc.\nThis is a story of head-over-heels expansion and head-over-\nheels debt, ending up in terrific losses and a host of financial prob-\nlems. As usually happens in such cases, a fair-haired boy, or\n“young genius,” was chiefly responsible for both the creation of the\ngreat empire and its ignominious downfall; but there is plenty of\nblame to be accorded others as well.‡\n*Arailroad’s “transportation ratio” (now more commonly called its operating\nratio) measures the expenses of running its trains divided by the railroad’s\ntotal revenues. The higher the ratio, the less efficient the railroad. Today\neven a ratio of 70% would be considered excellent.\n†Today, Penn Central is a faded memory. In 1976, it was absorbed into\nConsolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), a federally-funded holding company\nthat bailed out several failed railroads. Conrail sold shares to the public in\n1987 and, in 1997, was taken over jointly by CSX Corp. and Norfolk South-\nern Corp.\n‡Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. was founded in 1955 by James Joseph Ling, an\nelectwricawl cwon.tfraxc1to6r w1h8o .scoold mhis first $1 million worth of shares to the pub-426 The Intelligent Investor\nThe rise and fall of Ling-Temco-Vought can be summarized by\nsetting forth condensed income accounts and balance-sheet items\nfor five years between 1958 and 1970. This is done in Table 17-1.\nThe first column shows the company’s modest beginnings in 1958,\nwhen its sales were only $7 million. The next gives figures for 1960;\nthe enterprise had grown twentyfold in only two years, but it was\nstill comparatively small. Then came the heyday years to 1967 and\n1968, in which sales again grew twentyfold to $2.8 billion with the\ndebt figure expanding from $44 million to an awesome $1,653 mil-\nlion. In 1969 came new acquisitions, a further huge increase in debt\n(to a total of $1,865 million!), and the beginning of serious trouble.\nAlarge loss, after extraordinary items, was reported for the year;\nthe stock price declined from its 1967 high of 1691⁄ to a low of 24;\n2\nthe young genius was superseded as the head of the company. The\n1970 results were even more dreadful. The enterprise reported a\nfinal net loss of close to $70 million; the stock fell away to a low\nprice of 71⁄, and its largest bond issue was quoted at one time at a\n8\npitiable 15 cents on the dollar. The company’s expansion policy\nwas sharply reversed, various of its important interests were\nplaced on the market, and some headway was made in reducing its\nmountainous obligations.\nThe figures in our table speak so eloquently that few comments\nare called for. But here are some:\nlic by becoming his own investment banker, hawking prospectuses from a\nbooth set up at the Texas State Fair. His success at that led him to acquire\ndozens of different companies, almost always using LTV’s stock to pay for\nthem. The more companies LTV acquired, the higher its stock went; the\nhigher its stock went, the more companies it could afford to acquire. By\n1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune500 list of major U.S.\ncorporations. And then, as Graham shows, the whole house of cards came\ncrashing down. (LTV Corp., now exclusively a steelmaker, ended up seeking\nbankruptcy protection in late 2000.) Companies that grow primarily through\nacquisitions are called “serial acquirers”—and the similarity to the term\n“serial killers” is no accident. As the case of LTV demonstrates, serial acquir-\ners nearly always leave financial death and destruction in their wake.\nInvestors who understood this lesson of Graham’s would have avoided such\ndarlings of the 1990s as Conseco, Tyco, and WorldCom.\nwww.fx1618.com0791–8591\n,.cnI\nthguoV-ocmeT-gniL\n1-71\nELBAT\n)erahS\nreP\ndenraE\ntpecxE\nsralloD\nfo\nsnoilliM\nnI(\n0791\n9691\n7691\n0691\n8591\nstluseR\ngnitarepO\n.A\n0.473$\n0.057,3$\n0.338,1$\n0.341$\n9.6\n$\nselaS\n0.88\n4.421\n6.59\n782.7\n255.0\ntseretni\ndna\nsexat\nerofeb\nteN\n3.821\n6.221\n7.71\n).tse(\n5.1\n).tse(\n1.\nsegrahc\ntseretnI\n)(cid:1)86.0(\n)(cid:1)20.1(\n)(cid:1)45(\n)(cid:1)8.4(\n)(cid:1)\n5.5(\n)denrae\nsemiT(\n9.4\n2.51\n.rc\n6.53\n686.2\n522.0\nsexat\nemocnI\n8.81\n.rd\n6.04\n.rd\nsmeti\nlaicepS\n6.96\n.rd\n3.83\n.rd\n0.43\n150.3\n722.0\nsmeti\nlaiceps\nretfa\nteN\n3.17\n.rd\n8.04\n.rd\n7.03\n150.3\n202.0\nkcots\nnommoc\nrof\necnalaB\n81.71\n.fed\n95.01\n.fed\n65.5\n38.0\n71.0\nnommoc\nfo erahs\nrep\ndenraE\nnoitisoP\nlaicnaniF\n.B\n0.285,2\n0.449,2\n0.548\n5.49\n4.6\nstessa\nlatoT\n3.103\n3.983\n0.561\n3.92\n5.1\nraey\n1\nnihtiw\nelbayap\ntbeD\n6.493,1\n8.005,1\n6.202\n6.41\n5.\ntbed\nmret-gnoL\n*0.96\n.fed\n*0.21\n.fed\n†0.542\n5.82\n7.2\nytiuqe\n’sredloherahS\nsoitaR\n(cid:1)54.1\n(cid:1)25.1\n(cid:1)08.1\n(cid:1)54.1\n(cid:1)\n72.1\nseitilibail\ntnerruc/stessa\ntnerruC\n(cid:1)31.0\n(cid:1)71.0\n(cid:1)2.1\n(cid:1)0.2\n(cid:1)\n4.5\ntbed\nmret-gnol/ytiuqE\n⁄17–⁄192\n⁄142–⁄379\n901–⁄1961\n02–82\negnar\necirp-tekraM\n8\n2\n8\n4\n2\n.eulav\nnoitpmeder\nta\nkcots\nderreferp\ngnitcuded\ndna\ntessa\nna\nsa\ntnuocsid-tbed\ngnidulcxE*\n.ticifed:.fed.tibed:.rd\n.tiderc:.rc\n.dehsilbup\nsA†\nwww.fx1618.com428 The Intelligent Investor\n1. The company’s expansion period was not without an inter-\nruption. In 1961 it showed a small operating deficit, but—adopting\na practice that was to be seen later in so many reports for 1970—\nevidently decided to throw all possible charges and reserves into\nthe one bad year.* These amounted to a round $13 million, which\nwas more than the combined net profits of the preceding three\nyears. It was now ready to show “record earnings” in 1962, etc.\n2. At the end of 1966 the net tangible assets are given as $7.66 per\nshare of common (adjusted for a 3-for-2 split). Thus the market\nprice in 1967 reached 22 times (!) its reported asset value at the\ntime. At the end of 1968 the balance sheet showed $286 million\navailable for 3,800,000 shares of common and Class AA stock, or\nabout $77 per share. But if we deduct the preferred stock at full\nvalue and exclude the good-will items and the huge bond-discount\n“asset,”† there would remain $13 million for the common—a mere\n$3 per share. This tangible equity was wiped out by the losses of\nthe following years.\n3. Toward the end of 1967 two of our best-regarded banking\nfirms offered 600,000 shares of Ling-Temco-Vought stock at $111\nper share. It had been as high as 1691⁄. In less than three years the\n2\nprice fell to 71⁄.‡\n8\n*The sordid tradition of hiding a company’s true earnings picture under the\ncloak of restructuring charges is still with us. Piling up every possible charge\nin one year is sometimes called “big bath” or “kitchen sink” accounting. This\nbookkeeping gimmick enables companies to make an easy show of appar-\nent growth in the following year—but investors should not mistake that for\nreal business health.\n†The “bond-discount asset” appears to mean that LTV had purchased\nsome bonds below their par value and was treating that discount as an\nasset, on the grounds that the bonds could eventually be sold at par. Gra-\nham scoffs at this, since there is rarely any way to know what a bond’s mar-\nket price will be on a given date in the future. If the bonds could be sold only\nat values belowpar, this “asset” would in fact be a liability.\n‡We can only imagine what Graham would have thought of the investment\nbanking firms that brought InfoSpace, Inc. public in December 1998.

At the end of 1967 the bank loans had reached $161 million,\nand a year later they stood at $414 million—which should have\nbeen a frightening figure. In addition, the long-term debt\namounted to $1,237 million. By 1969 combined debt reached a total\nof $1,869 million. This may have been the largest combined debt\nfigure of any industrial company anywhere and at any time, with\nthe single exception of the impregnable Standard Oil of N.J.\n5. The losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since\nthe formation of the company.\nMoral: The primary question raised in our mind by the Ling-\nTemco-Vought story is how the commercial bankers could have\nbeen persuaded to lend the company such huge amounts of money\nduring its expansion period. In 1966 and earlier the company’s\ncoverage of interest charges did not meet conservative standards,\nand the same was true of the ratio of current assets to current liabil-\nities and of stock equity to total debt. But in the next two years the\nbanks advanced the enterprise nearly $400 million additional for\nfurther “diversification.” This was not good business for them, and\nit was worse in its implications for the company’s shareholders. If\nthe Ling-Temco-Vought case will serve to keep commercial banks\nfrom aiding and abetting unsound expansions of this type in the\nfuture, some good may come of it at last.*\nThe NVF Takeover of Sharon Steel (ACollector’s Item)\nAt the end of 1968 NVF Company was a company with $4.6 mil-\nlion of long-term debt, $17.4 million of stock capital, $31 million of\nsales, and $502,000 of net income (before a special credit of\n$374,000). Its business was described as “vulcanized fiber and plas-\ntics.” The management decided to take over the Sharon Steel Corp.,\n$1305.32 per share in March 2000, and finished 2002 at a princely $8.45\nper share.\n*Graham would have been disappointed, though surely not surprised, to\nsee that commercial banks have chronically kept supporting “unsound\nexpansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in corpo-\nrate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank loans.\nwww.fx1618.com430 The Intelligent Investor\nwhich had $43 million of long-term debt, $101 million of stock cap-\nital, $219 million of sales, and $2,929,000 of net earnings. The com-\npany it wished to acquire was thus seven times the size of NVF. In\nearly 1969 it made an offer for all the shares of Sharon. The terms\nper share were $70 face amount of NVF junior 5% bonds, due 1994,\nplus warrants to buy 11⁄ shares of NVF stock at $22 per share of\n2\nNVF. The management of Sharon strenuously resisted this\ntakeover attempt, but in vain. NVF acquired 88% of the Sharon\nstock under the offer, issuing therefore $102 million of its 5% bonds\nand warrants for 2,197,000 of its shares. Had the offer been 100%\noperative the consolidated enterprise would, for the year 1968,\nhave had $163 million in debt, only $2.2 million in tangible stock\ncapital, $250 million of sales. The net-earnings question would\nhave been a bit complicated, but the company subsequently stated\nthem as a net loss of 50 cents per share of NVF stocks, before an\nextraordinary credit, and net earnings of 3 cents per share after\nsuch credit.*\nFirst Comment: Among all the takeovers effected in the year\n1969 this was no doubt the most extreme in its financial dispropor-\ntions. The acquiring company had assumed responsibility for a\nnew and top-heavy debt obligation, and it had changed its calcu-\nlated 1968 earnings from a profit to a loss into the bargain. Amea-\nsure of the impairment of the company’s financial position by this\n*In June 1972 (just after Graham finished this chapter), a Federal judge\nfound that NVF’s chairman, Victor Posner, had improperly diverted the pen-\nsion assets of Sharon Steel “to assist affiliated companies in their takeovers\nof other corporations.” In 1977, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion secured a permanent injunction against Posner, NVF, and Sharon Steel\nto prevent them from future violations of Federal laws against securities\nfraud. The Commission alleged that Posner and his family had improperly\nobtained $1.7 million in personal perks from NVF and Sharon, overstated\nSharon’s pretax earnings by $13.9 million, misrecorded inventory, and\n“shifted income and expenses from one year to another.” Sharon Steel,\nwhich Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical eye, became\nknown among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner was later a\ncentral force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile takeovers that\nswept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a major customer for\nthe junk bwonwdsw u.nfdxe1rw6rit1te8n .bcy oDrmexel Burnham Lambert.Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories 431\nstep is found in the fact that the new 5% bonds did not sell higher\nthan 42 cents on the dollar during the year of issuance. This would\nhave indicated grave doubt of the safety of the bonds and of the\ncompany’s future; however, the management actually exploited\nthe bond price in a way to save the company annual income taxes\nof about $1,000,000 as will be shown.\nThe 1968 report, published after the Sharon takeover, contained\na condensed picture of its results, carried back to the year-end. This\ncontained two most unusual items:\n1. There is listed as an asset $58,600,000 of “deferred debt\nexpense.” This sum is greater than the entire “stockholders’\nequity,” placed at $40,200,000.\n2. However, not included in the shareholders’ equity is an item\nof $20,700,000 designated as “excess of equity over cost of invest-\nment in Sharon.”\nSecond Comment: If we eliminate the debt expense as an asset,\nwhich it hardly seems to be, and include the other item in the\nshareholders’ equity (where it would normally belong), then we\nhave a more realistic statement of tangible equity for NVF stock,\nviz., $2,200,000. Thus the first effect of the deal was to reduce\nNVF’s “real equity” from $17,400,000 to $2,200,000 or from $23.71\nper share to about $3 per share, on 731,000 shares. In addition the\nNVF shareholders had given to others the right to buy 31⁄ times as\n2\nmany additional shares at six points below the market price at the\nclose of 1968. The initial market value of the warrants was then\nabout $12 each, or a total of some $30 million for those involved in\nthe purchase offer. Actually, the market value of the warrants well\nexceeded the total market value of the outstanding NVF stock—\nanother evidence of the tail-wagging-dog nature of the transaction.\nThe Accounting Gimmicks\nWhen we pass from this pro forma balance sheet to the next\nyear’s report we find several strange-appearing entries. In addition\nto the basic interest expense (a hefty $7,500,000), there is deducted\n$1,795,000 for “amortization of deferred debt expense.” But this\nlast iws nweawrl.yf xof1fs6et1 o8n .tchoe mnext line by a very unusual income item432 The Intelligent Investor\nindeed: “amortization of equity over cost of investment in sub-\nsidiary: Cr. $1,650,000.” In one of the footnotes we find an entry,\nnot appearing in any other report that we know of: Part of the stock\ncapital is there designated as “fair market value of warrants issued\nin connection with acquisition, etc., $22,129,000.”\nWhat on earth do all these entries mean? None of them is even\nreferred to in the descriptive text of the 1969 report. The trained\nsecurity analyst has to figure out these mysteries by himself,\nalmost in detective fashion. He finds that the underlying idea is to\nderive a tax advantage from the low initial price of the 5% deben-\ntures. For readers who may be interested in this ingenious arrange-\nment we set forth our solution in Appendix 6.\nOther Unusual Items\n1. Right after the close of 1969 the company bought in no less\nthan 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. This was extraordi-\nnary when we consider that (a) NVF itself had only $700,000 in\ncash at the year-end, and had $4,400,000 of debt due in 1970 (evi-\ndently the $6 million paid for the warrants had to be borrowed); (b)\nit was buying in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5%\nbonds were selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar—ordinarily a\nwarning that financial difficulties lay ahead.\n2. As a partial offset to this, the company had retired $5,100,000\nof its bonds along with 253,000 warrants in exchange for a like\namount of common stock. This was possible because, by the\nvagaries of the securities markets, people were selling the 5%\nbonds at less than 40 while the common sold at an average price of\n131⁄, paying no dividend.\n2\n3. The company had plans in operation not only for selling stock\nto its employees, but also for selling them a larger number of war-\nrantsto buy the stock. Like the stock purchases the warrants were\nto be paid for 5% down and the rest over many years in the future.\nThis is the only such employee-purchase plan for warrantsthat we\nknow of. Will someone soon invent and sell on installments a right\nto buy a right to buy a share, and so on?\n4. In the year 1969 the newly controlled Sharon Steel Co.\nchangedw iwts wm.efxth1od6 1o8f .acrroivming at its pension costs, and alsoFour Extremely Instructive Case Histories 433\nadopted lower depreciation rates. These accounting changes added\nabout $1 per share to the reported earnings of NVF before dilution.\n5. At the end of 1970 Standard & Poor’s Stock Guidereported that\nNVF shares were selling at a price/earning ratio of only 2, the lowest\nfigure for all the 4,500-odd issues in the booklet. As the old Wall Street\nsaying went, this was “important if true.” The ratio was based on the\nyear’s closing price of 83⁄ and the computed “earnings” of $5.38 per\n4\nshare for the 12 months ended September 1970. (Using these figures\nthe shares were selling at only 1.6 times earnings.) But this ratio did\nnot allow for the large dilution factor,* nor for the adverse results\nactually realized in the last quarter of 1970. When the full year’s fig-\nures finally appeared, they showed only $2.03 per share earned for\nthe stock, before allowing for dilution, and $1.80 per share on a\ndiluted basis. Note also that the aggregate market price of the stock\nand warrants on that date was about $14 million against a bonded\ndebt of $135 million—a skimpy equity position indeed.\nAAAEnterprises\nHistory\nAbout 15 years ago a college student named Williams began\nselling mobile homes (then called “trailers”).† In 1965 he incorpo-\n*The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees exer-\ncised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then have to\nissue more shares, and its net earnings would be divided across a much\ngreater number of shares outstanding.\n†Jackie G. Williams founded AAA Enterprises in 1958. On its first day of trad-\ning, the stock soared 56% to close at $20.25. Williams later announced that\nAAA would come up with a new franchising concept every month (if people\nwould step into a mobile home to get their income taxes done by “Mr. Tax of\nAmerica,” just imagine what else they might do inside a trailer!). But AAA ran\nout of time and money before Williams ran out of ideas. The history of AAA\nEnterprises is reminiscent of the saga of a later company with charismatic man-\nagement and scanty assets: ZZZZ Best achieved a stock-market value of\nroughly $200 million in the late 1980s, even though its purported industrial\nvacuum-cleaning business was little more than a telephone and a rented office\nrun bwy aw tewen.afgxe1r n6a1me8d. cBaorrmy Minkow. ZZZZ Best went bust and Minkow434 The Intelligent Investor\nrated his business. In that year he sold $5,800,000 of mobile homes\nand earned $61,000 before corporate tax. By 1968 he had joined the\n“franchising” movement and was selling others the right to sell\nmobile homes under his business name. He also conceived the\nbright idea of going into the business of preparing income-tax\nreturns, using his mobile homes as offices. He formed a subsidiary\ncompany called Mr. Tax of America, and of course started to sell\nfranchises to others to use the idea and the name. He multiplied\nthe number of corporate shares to 2,710,000 and was ready for a\nstock offering. He found that one of our largest stock-exchange\nhouses, along with others, was willing to handle the deal. In March\n1969 they offered the public 500,000 shares of AAAEnterprises at\n$13 per share. Of these, 300,000 were sold for Mr. Williams’s per-\nsonal account and 200,000 were sold for the company account,\nadding $2,400,000 to its resources. The price of the stock promptly\ndoubled to 28, or a value of $84 million for the equity, against a\nbook value of, say, $4,200,000 and maximum reported earnings of\n$690,000. The stock was thus selling at a tidy 115 times its current\n(and largest) earnings per share. No doubt Mr. Williams had\nselected the name AAAEnterprise so that it might be among the\nfirst in the phone books and the yellow pages. Acollateral result\nwas that his company was destined to appear as the first name in\nStandard & Poor’s Stock Guide. Like Abu-Ben-Adhem’s, it led all\nthe rest.* This gives a special reason to select it as a harrowing\nexample of 1969 new financing and “hot issues.”\nComment: This was not a bad deal for Mr. Williams. The\n300,000 shares he sold had a book value in December of 1968 of\n$180,000 and he netted therefor 20 times as much, or a cool\n$3,600,000. The underwriters and distributors split $500,000\nbetween them, less expenses.\nwent to jail. Even as you read this, another similar company is being formed,\nand a new generation of “investors” will be taken for a ride. No one who has\nread Graham, however, should climb on board.\n*In “Abou Ben Adhem,” by the British Romantic poet Leigh Hunt\n(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book\n“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that his\nname is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as one that\nloves his fellow men.” The angel returns the next night to show Abou the\nbook, in wwhwichw no.fwx “1Be6n1 A8dh.cemo’sm name led all the rest.”Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories 435\n1. This did not seem so brilliant a deal for the clients of the sell-\ning houses. They were asked to pay about ten times the book value\nof the stock, after the bootstrap operation of increasing their equity\nper share from 59 cents to $1.35 with their own money.* Before the\nbest year 1968, the company’s maximum earnings had been a\nridiculous 7 cents per share. There were ambitious plans for the\nfuture, of course—but the public was being asked to pay heavily in\nadvance for the hoped-for realization of these plans.\n2. Nonetheless, the price of the stock doubled soon after original\nissuance, and any one of the brokerage-house clients could have\ngotten out at a handsome profit. Did this fact alter the flotation, or\ndid the advance possibility that it might happen exonerate the\noriginal distributors of the issue from responsibility for this public\noffering and its later sequel? Not an easy question to answer, but it\ndeserves careful consideration by Wall Street and the government\nregulatory agencies.†\nSubsequent History\nWith its enlarged capital AAA Enterprises went into two addi-\ntional businesses. In 1969 it opened a chain of retail carpet stores, and\nit acquired a plant that manufactured mobile homes. The results\nreported for the first nine months were not exactly brilliant, but they\nwere a little better than the year before—22 cents a share against 14\n*By purchasing more common stock at a premium to its book value, the\ninvesting public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But investors\nwere only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since most of the\nrise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own willingness to over-\npay for the stock.\n†Graham’s point is that investment banks are not entitled to take credit for\nthe gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial public offering unless\nthey are also willing to take the blame for the stock’s performance in the\nlonger term. Many Internet IPOs rose 1,000% or more in 1999 and early\n2000; most of them lost more than 95% in the subsequent three years.\nHow could these early gains earned by a few investors justify the massive\ndestruction of wealth suffered by the millions who came later? Many IPOs\nwere, in fact, deliberately underpriced to “manufacture” immediate gains\nthat wwouwldw at.trfaxc1t m6o1re8 a.ttcenotimon for the next offering.436 The Intelligent Investor\ncents. What happened in the next months was literally incredible.\nThe company lost $4,365,000, or $1.49 per share. This consumed all its\ncapital before the financing, plus the entire $2,400,000 received on the\nsale of stock plus two-thirds of the amount reported as earned in the\nfirst nine months of 1969. There was left a pathetic $242,000, or 8 cents\nper share, of capital for the public shareholders who had paid $13 for\nthe new offering only seven months before. Nonetheless the shares\nclosed the year 1969 at 81⁄ bid, or a “valuation” of more than $25 mil-\n8\nlion for the company.\nFurther Comment: 1. It is too much to believe that the company\nhad actually earned $686,000 from January to September 1969 and\nthen lost $4,365,000 in the next three months. There was something\nsadly, badly, and accusingly wrong about the September 30 report.\n2. The year’s closing price of 81⁄ bid was even more of a demon-\n8\nstration of the complete heedlessness of stock-market prices than\nwere the original offering price of 13 or the subsequent “hot-issue”\nadvance to a high bid of 28. These latter quotations at least were\nbased on enthusiasm and hope—out of all proportion to reality and\ncommon sense, but at least comprehensible. The year-end valuation\nof $25 million was given to a company that had lost all but a minus-\ncule remnant of its capital, for which a completely insolvent condi-\ntion was imminent, and for which the words “enthusiasm” or “hope”\nwould be only bitter sarcasms. (It is true the year-end figures had not\nbeen published by December 31, but it is the business of Wall Street\nhouses associated with a company to have monthly operating state-\nments and a fairly exact idea of how things are going.)\nFinal Chapter\nFor the first half of 1970 the company reported a further loss of\n$1 million. It now had a good-sized capital deficit. It was kept out\nof bankruptcy by loans made by Mr. Williams, up to a total of\n$2,500,000. No further statements seem to have been issued, until\nin January 1971 AAA Enterprises finally filed a petition in bank-\nruptcy. The quotation for the stock at month-end was still 50 cents\na share bid, or $1,500,000 for the entire issue, which evidently had\nno more than wallpaper value.

With a market capitalization of $192.9 bil-\nlion, it was the 12th-most-valuable company in America.\nWas that giant valuation justified? Let’s look at some basics from\nLucent’s financial report for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2000:1\n1This document, like all the financial reports cited in this chapter, is readily\navailable wto wthew pu.fbxlic1 th6ro1u8gh. cthoe mEDGAR Database at www.sec.gov.\n438Commentary on Chapter 17 439\nFIGURE 17-1 Lucent Technologies Inc.\nFor the quarter ended...\nJune 30, 2000 June 30, 1999\nIncome\nRevenues 8,713 7,403\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations (14) 622\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations (287) 141\nNet income (301) 763\nAssets\nCash 710 1,495\nReceivables 10,101 9,486\nGoodwill 8,736 3,340*\nCapitalized software development costs 576 412\nTotal assets 46,340 37,156\nAll numbers in millions of dollars. *Other assets, which includes goodwill.\nSource: Lucent quarterly financial reports (Form 10-Q).\nA closer reading of Lucent’s report sets alarm bells jangling like an\nunanswered telephone switchboard:\n• Lucent had just bought an optical equipment supplier, Chromatis\nNetworks, for $4.8 billion—of which $4.2 billion was “goodwill” (or\ncost above book value). Chromatis had 150 employees, no cus-\ntomers, and zero revenues, so the term “goodwill” seems inade-\nquate; perhaps “hope chest” is more accurate. If Chromatis’s\nembryonic products did not work out, Lucent would have to\nreverse the goodwill and charge it off against future earnings.\n• A footnote discloses that Lucent had lent $1.5 billion to pur-\nchasers of its products. Lucent was also on the hook for $350\nmillion in guarantees for money its customers had borrowed else-\nwhere. The total of these “customer financings” had doubled in a\nyear—suggesting that purchasers were running out of cash to buy\nLucent’s products. What if they ran out of cash to pay their\ndebts?\n• Finally, Lucent treated the cost of developing new software as a\n“capital asset.” Rather than an asset, wasn’t that a routine busi-\nnwesws wex.pfexn1se6 t1ha8t .schooumld come out of earnings?440 Commentary on Chapter 17\nCONCLUSION: In August 2001, Lucent shut down the Chromatis\ndivision after its products reportedly attracted only two customers.2In\nfiscal year 2001, Lucent lost $16.2 billion; in fiscal year 2002, it lost\nanother $11.9 billion. Included in those losses were $3.5 billion in\n“provisions for bad debts and customer financings,” $4.1 billion in\n“impairment charges related to goodwill,” and $362 million in charges\n“related to capitalized software.”\nLucent’s stock, at $51.062 on June 30, 2000, finished 2002 at\n$1.26—a loss of nearly $190 billion in market value in two-and-a-half\nyears.\nTHE ACQUISITION MAGICIAN\nTo describe Tyco International Ltd., we can only paraphrase Winston\nChurchill and say that never has so much been sold by so many to so\nfew. From 1997 through 2001, this Bermuda-based conglomerate spent\na total of more than $37 billion—most of it in shares of Tyco stock—buying\ncompanies the way Imelda Marcos bought shoes. In fiscal year 2000\nalone, according to its annual report, Tyco acquired “approximately 200\ncompanies”—an average of more than one every other day.\nThe result? Tyco grew phenomenally fast; in five years, revenues\nwent from $7.6 billion to $34 billion, and operating income shot from a\n$476 million loss to a $6.2 billion gain. No wonder the company had a\ntotal stock-market value of $114 billion at the end of 2001.\nBut Tyco’s financial statements were at least as mind-boggling as\nits growth. Nearly every year, they featured hundreds of millions of dol-\nlars in acquisition-related charges. These expenses fell into three main\ncategories:\n1) “merger” or “restructuring” or “other nonrecurring” costs,\n2) “charges for the impairment of long-lived assets,” and\n3) “write-offs of purchased in-process research and development.”\nFor the sake of brevity, let’s refer to the first kind of charge as\nMORON, the second as CHILLA, and the third as WOOPIPRAD. How\ndid they show up over time?\n2The demise of the Chromatis acquisition is discussed in The Financial Times,\nAugust 29, 2001, p. 1, and September 1/September 2, 2001, p.

CHILLA cropped up just as chronically and amounted to\nmore than $700 million. WOOPIPRAD came to another half-billion dol-\nlars.3\nThe intelligent investor would ask:\n• If Tyco’s strategy of growth-through-acquisition was such a neat\nidea, how come it had to spend an average of $750 million a year\ncleaning up after itself?\n• If, as seems clear, Tyco was not in the business of making things—\nbut rather in the business of buying other companies that make\nthings—then why were its MORON charges “nonrecurring”?\nWeren’t they just part of Tyco’s normal costs of doing business?\n• And with accounting charges for past acquisitions junking up every\nyear’s earnings, who could tell what next year’s would be?\n3When accounting for acquisitions, loading up on WOOPIPRAD enabled\nTyco to reduce the portion of the purchase price that it allocated to goodwill.\nSince WOOPIPRAD can be expensed up front, while goodwill (under the\naccounting rules then in force) had to be written off over multi-year periods,\nthis maneuver enabled Tyco to minimize the impact of goodwill charges on\nits future earnings.\nwww.fx1618.com442 Commentary on Chapter 17\nIn fact, an investor couldn’t even tell what Tyco’s past earnings\nwere. In 1999, after an accounting review by the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission, Tyco retroactively added $257 million in\nMORON charges to its 1998 expenses—meaning that those “nonre-\ncurring” costs had actually recurred in that year, too. At the same time,\nthe company rejiggered its originally reported 1999 charges:\nMORONdropped to $929 million while CHILLA rose to $507 million.\nTyco was clearly growing in size, but was it growing more prof-\nitable? No outsider could safely tell.\nCONCLUSION: In fiscal year 2002, Tyco lost $9.4 billion. The\nstock, which had closed at $58.90 at year-end 2001, finished 2002 at\n$17.08—a loss of 71% in twelve months.4\nA MINNOW SWALLOWS A WHALE\nOn January 10, 2000, America Online, Inc. and Time Warner Inc.\nannounced that they would merge in a deal initially valued at $156\nbillion.\nAs of December 31, 1999, AOL had $10.3 billion in assets, and its\nrevenues over the previous 12 months had amounted to $5.7 billion.\nTime Warner, on the other hand, had $51.2 billion in assets and rev-\nenues of $27.3 billion. Time Warner was a vastly bigger company by\nany measure except one: the valuation of its stock. Because America\nOnline bedazzled investors simply by being in the Internet industry, its\nstock sold for a stupendous 164 times its earnings. Stock in Time\nWarner, a grab bag of cable television, movies, music, and magazines,\nsold for around 50 times earnings.\nIn announcing the deal, the two companies called it a “strategic\nmerger of equals.” Time Warner’s chairman, Gerald M.

AOL Time Warner Inc. lost $4.9 billion in 2001 and—in the\nmost gargantuan loss ever recorded by a corporation—another $98.7\nbillion in 2002. Most of the losses came from writing down the value\nof America Online.

Four\nof Wall Street’s most prestigious investment banks—Goldman, Sachs\n& Co.; BancBoston Robertson Stephens; Donaldson, Lufkin & Jen-\nrette; and Merrill Lynch & Co.—underwrote 8,320,000 shares at $20\napiece, raising $166.4 million. The stock roared up, closing at\n$76.5625, a 282.8% gain in its first day of trading.

But, in its 20 months in business,\neToys had produced total sales of $30.6 million, on which it had run a\nnet loss of $30.8 million—meaning that eToys was spending $2 to sell\nevery dollar’s worth of toys.\nThe IPO prospectus also disclosed that eToys would use some\nproceeds of the offering to acquire another online operation, Baby-\nCenter, Inc., which had lost $4.5 million on $4.8 million in sales over\nthe previous year. (To land this prize, eToys would pay a mere $205\nmillion.) And eToys would “reserve” 40.6 million shares of common\nstock for future issuance to its management. So, if eToys ever made\nmoney, its net income would have to be divided not among 102 million\nshares, but among 143 million—diluting any future earnings per share\nby nearly one-third.\nA comparison of eToys with Toys “R” Us, Inc.—its biggest rival—is\nshocking.

By\nselecting eight pairs of companies which appear next to each other,\nor nearly so, on the stock-exchange list we hope to bring home in a\nconcrete and vivid manner some of the many varieties of character,\nfinancial structure, policies, performance, and vicissitudes of cor-\nporate enterprises, and of the investment and speculative attitudes\nfound on the financial scene in recent years. In each comparison we\nshall comment only on those aspects that have a special meaning\nand import.\nPair I: Real Estate Investment Trust (stores, offices, factories,\netc.) and Realty Equities Corp. of New York (real estate\ninvestment; general construction)\nIn this first comparison we depart from the alphabetical order\nused for the other pairs. It has a special significance for us, since it\nseems to encapsulate, on the one hand, all that has been reason-\nable, stable, and generally good in the traditional methods of\nhandling other people’s money, in contrast—in the other com-\npany—with the reckless expansion, the financial legerdemain, and\nthe roller-coaster changes so often found in present-day corporate\noperations. The two enterprises have similar names, and for many\nyears they appeared side by side on the American Stock Exchange\nlist. Their stock-ticker symbols—REI and REC—could easily have\nbeen confused. But one of them is a staid New England trust,\nadministered by three trustees, with operations dating back nearly\na century, and with dividends paid continuously since 1889. It has\nkept throughout to the same type of prudent investments, limiting\nwww.fx1618.com\n446AComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 447\nits expansion to a moderate rate and its debt to an easily manage-\nable figure.*\nThe other is a typical New York-based sudden-growth venture,\nwhich in eight years blew up its assets from $6.2 million to $154\nmillion, and its debts in the same proportion; which moved out\nfrom ordinary real-estate operations to a miscellany of ventures,\nincluding two racetracks, 74 movie theaters, three literary agencies,\na public-relations firm, hotels, supermarkets, and a 26% interest in\na large cosmetics firm (which went bankrupt in 1970).† This con-\nglomeration of business ventures was matched by a corresponding\nvariety of corporate devices, including the following:\n1. Apreferred stock entitled to $7 annual dividends, but with a\npar value of only $1, and carried as a liability at $1 per share.\n2. A stated common-stock value of $2,500,000 ($1 per share),\nmore than offset by a deduction of $5,500,000 as the cost of\n209,000 shares of reacquired stock.\n3. Three series of stock-option warrants, giving rights to buy a\ntotal of 1,578,000 shares.\n4. At least six different kinds of debt obligations, in the form of\nmortgages, debentures, publicly held notes, notes payable to\nbanks, “notes, loans, and contracts payable,” and loans\npayable to the Small Business Administration, adding up to\nover $100 million in March 1969. In addition it had the usual\ntaxes and accounts payable.\nLet us present first a few figures of the two enterprises as they\nappeared in 1960 (Table 18-1A).

By\npaying as little attention as possible to the Trust and a lot to Realty\nEquities. In 1968 the latter shot up from 10 to 373⁄ and the listed\n4\nwarrants from 6 to 361⁄, on combined sales of 2,420,000 shares.\n2\nWhile this was happening the Trust shares advanced sedately from\n20 to 301⁄ on modest volume. The March 1969 balance sheet of\n4\nEquities was to show an asset value of only $3.41 per share, less\nthan a tenth of its high price that year. The book value of the Trust\nshares was $20.85.\n*Graham, an avid reader of poetry, is quoting Thomas Gray’s “Elegy Written\nin a Country Churchyard.”\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 449\nTABLE 18-1B.

When the report for March 1970\n2\nappeared the shareholders must have felt shell-shocked as they\nread that the enterprise had sustained a net loss of $13,200,000, or\n$5.17 per share—virtually wiping out their former slim equity.\n(This disastrous figure included a reserve of $8,800,000 for future\nlosses on investments.) Nonetheless the directors had bravely (?)\ndeclared an extra dividend of 5 cents right after the close of the fis-\ncal year. But more trouble was in sight. The company’s auditors\nrefused to certify the financial statements for 1969–70, and the\nshares were suspended from trading on the American Stock\nExchange. In the over-the-counter market the bid price dropped\nbelow $2 per share.*\nReal Estate Investment Trust shares had typical price fluctuations\nafter 1969. The low in 1970 was 161⁄, with a recovery to 265⁄ in early\n2 6\n1971. The latest reported earnings were $1.50 per share, and the stock\nwas selling moderately above its 1970 book value of $21.60. The issue\nmay have been somewhat overpriced at its record high in 1968, but the\nshareholders have been honestly and well served by their trustees.\nThe Real Estate Equities story is a different and a sorry one.\nPair 2: Air Products and Chemicals (industrial and medical\ngases, etc.) and Air Reduction Co. (industrial gases and\nequipment; chemicals)\nEven more than our first pair, these two resemble each other in\nboth name and line of business. The comparison they invite is thus\nof the conventional type in security analysis, while most of our\nother pairs are more heteroclite in nature.† “Products” is a newer\n*Realty Equities was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in Sep-\ntember 1973. In 1974, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued\nRealty Equities’ accountants for fraud. Realty Equities’ founder, Morris Karp,\nlater pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny. In 1974–1975, the\noverindebtedness that Graham criticizes led to a financial crisis among large\nbanks, including Chase Manhattan, that had lent heavily to the most aggres-\nsive realty trusts.\n†“Heteroclite” is a technical term from classical Greek that Graham uses to\nmean abwnorwmawl o.rf xun1us6u1al.8.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 451\ncompany than “Reduction,” and in 1969 had less than half the\nother’s volume.* Nonetheless its equity issues sold for 25% more in\nthe aggregate than Air Reduction’s stock. As Table 18-2 shows, the\nreason can be found both in Air Reduction’s greater profitability\nand in its stronger growth record. We find here the typical conse-\nquences of a better showing of “quality.” Air Products sold at 161⁄\n2\ntimes its latest earnings against only 9.1 times for Air Reduction.\nAlso Air Products sold well above its asset backing, while Air\nReduction could be bought at only 75% of its book value.† Air\nReduction paid a more liberal dividend; but this may be deemed to\nreflect the greater desirability for Air Products to retain its earn-\nings. Also, Air Reduction had a more comfortable working-capital\nposition. (On this point we may remark that a profitable company\ncan always put its current position in shape by some form of per-\nmanent financing. But by our standards Air Products was some-\nwhat overbonded.)\nIf the analyst were called on to choose between the two compa-\nnies he would have no difficulty in concluding that the prospects\nof Air Products looked more promising than those of Air Reduc-\ntion. But did this make Air Products more attractive at its consider-\nably higher relative price? We doubt whether this question can be\nanswered in a definitive fashion. In general Wall Street sets “qual-\nity” above “quantity” in its thinking, and probably the majority of\nsecurity analysts would opt for the “better” but dearer Air Prod-\nucts as against the “poorer” but cheaper Air Reduction. Whether\nthis preference is to prove right or wrong is more likely to depend\non the unpredictable future than on any demonstrable investment\nprinciple. In this instance, Air Reduction appears to belong to the\ngroup of important companies in the low-multiplier class. If, as the\nstudies referred to above†† would seem to indicate, that group as a\n*By “volume,” Graham is referring to sales or revenues—the total dollar\namount of each company’s business.\n†“Asset backing” and book value are synonyms. In Table 18-2, the relation-\nship of price to asset or book value can be seen by dividing the first line\n(“Price, December 31, 1969”) by “Book value per share.”\n††Graham is citing his research on value stocks, which he discusses in Chap-\nter 15 (see p. 389).

(Also, a\nthorough-going study of the individual companies could lead the\nanalyst to the opposite conclusion; but that would have to be for\nreasons beyond those already reflected in the past showing.)\nSequel: Air Products stood up better than Air Reduction in the\nTABLE 18-2.

However, Reduction\nmade a better comeback in early 1971, rising to 50% above its 1969\nclose, against 30% for Products. In this case the low-multiplier\nissue scored the advantage—for the time being, at least.*\nPair 3: American Home Products Co. (drugs, cosmetics,\nhousehold products, candy) and American Hospital Supply\nCo. (distributor and manufacturer of hospital supplies and\nequipment)\nThese were two “billion-dollar good-will” companies at the end\nof 1969, representing different segments of the rapidly growing\nand immensely profitable “health industry.” We shall refer to them\nas Home and Hospital, respectively. Selected data on both are pre-\nsented in Table 18-3. They had the following favorable points in\ncommon: excellent growth, with no setbacks since 1958 (i.e., 100%\nearnings stability); and strong financial condition. The growth rate\nof Hospital up to the end of 1969 was considerably higher than\nHome’s. On the other hand, Home enjoyed substantially better\nprofitability on both sales and capital.† (In fact, the relatively low\nrate of Hospital’s earnings on its capital in 1969—only 9.7%—raises\nthe intriguing question whether the business then was in fact a\nhighly profitable one, despite its remarkable past growth rate in\nsales and earnings.)\nWhen comparative price is taken into account, Home offered\n(cont’d from p. 451) growth stocks over long periods. (Much of the best\nresearch in modern finance simply provides independent confirmation of\nwhat Graham demonstrated decades ago.) See, for instance, James L.\nDavis, Eugene F. Fama, and Kenneth R.

The very low book value of Home illustrates a basic\nambiguity or contradiction in common-stock analysis. On the one\nhand, it means that the company is earning a high return on its\ncapital—which in general is a sign of strength and prosperity. On\nthe other, it means that the investor at the current price would be\nespecially vulnerable to any important adverse change in the\ncompany’s earnings situation. Since Hospital was selling at over\nfour times its book value in 1969, this cautionary remark must be\napplied to both companies.\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 455\nCONCLUSIONS: Our clear-cut view would be that both companies\nwere too “rich” at their current prices to be considered by the\ninvestor who decides to follow our ideas of conservative selection.\nThis does not mean that the companies were lacking in promise.\nThe trouble is, rather, that their price contained too much “prom-\nise” and not enough actual performance. For the two enterprises\ncombined, the 1969 price reflected almost $5 billion of good-will\nvaluation. How many years of excellent future earnings would it\ntake to “realize” that good-will factor in the form of dividends or\ntangible assets?\nSHORT-TERM SEQUEL: At the end of 1969 the market evidently\nthought more highly of the earnings prospects of Hospital than of\nHome, since it gave the former almost twice the multiplier of the\nlatter. As it happened the favored issue showed a microscopic\ndeclinein earnings in 1970, while Home turned in a respectable 8%\ngain. The market price of Hospital reacted significantly to this one-\nyear disappointment. It sold at 32 in February 1971—a loss of\nabout 30% from its 1969 close—while Home was quoted slightly\nabove its corresponding level.*\nPair 4: H & R Block, Inc. (income-tax service) and Blue Bell,\nInc., (manufacturers of work clothes, uniforms, etc.)\nThese companies rub shoulders as relative newcomers to the\nNew York Stock Exchange, where they represent two very different\ngenres of success stories. Blue Bell came up the hard way in a\nhighly competitive industry, in which eventually it became the\nlargest factor. Its earnings have fluctuated somewhat with industry\nconditions, but their growth since 1965 has been impressive. The\ncompany’s operations go back to 1916 and its continuous dividend\nrecord to 1923. At the end of 1969 the stock market showed no\nenthusiasm for the issue, giving it a price/earnings ratio of only 11,\nagainst about 17 for the S & Pcomposite index.\nBy contrast, the rise of H & R Block has been meteoric. Its first\n*American Home Products Co. is now known as Wyeth; the stock is\nincluded in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. American Hospital Sup-\nply Co. was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corp. in 1985.\nwww.fx1618.com456 The Intelligent Investor\npublished figures date only to 1961, in which year it earned $83,000\non revenues of $610,000. But eight years later, on our comparison\ndate, its revenues had soared to $53.6 million and its net to $6.3\nmillion. At that time the stock market’s attitude toward this fine\nperformer appeared nothing less than ecstatic. The price of 55 at\nthe close of 1969 was more than 100 times the last reported 12-\nmonths’ earnings—which of course were the largest to date. The\naggregate market value of $300 million for the stock issue was\nnearly 30 times the tangible assets behind the shares.* This was\nalmost unheard of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations.\n(At that time IBM was selling at about 9 times and Xerox at 11\ntimes book value.)\nOur Table 18-4 sets forth in dollar figures and in ratios the\nextraordinary discrepancy in the comparative valuations of Block\nand Blue Bell. True, Block showed twice the profitability of Blue\nBell per dollar of capital, and its percentage growth in earnings\nover the past five years (from practically nothing) was much\nhigher. But as a stock enterprise Blue Bell was selling for less than\none-third the total value of Block, although Blue Bell was doing\nfour times as much business, earning 21⁄ times as much for its\n2\nstock, had 51⁄ times as much in tangible investment, and gave nine\n2\ntimes the dividend yield on the price.\nINDICATED CONCLUSIONS: An experienced analyst would have\nconceded great momentum to Block, implying excellent prospects\nfor future growth.

The price of Block rose to 75 in February 1971, but Blue Bell\nadvanced considerably more—to the equivalent of 109 (after a\nthree-for-two split).

But the fact that Block was able to\nadvance some 35% from that apparently inflated value indicates\nhow wary analysts and investors must be to sell good companies\nshort—either by word or deed—no matter how high the quotation\nmay seem.*\nPair 5: International Flavors & Fragrances (flavors, etc., for\nother businesses) and International Harvester Co. (truck\nmanufacturer, farm machinery, construction machinery)\nThis comparison should carry more than one surprise. Everyone\nknows of International Harvester, one of the 30 giants in the Dow\nJones Industrial Average.† How many of our readers have even\nheard of International Flavors & Fragrances, next-door neighbor to\nHarvester on the New York Stock Exchange list? Yet, mirabile dictu,\nIFF was actually selling at the end of 1969 for a higher aggregate\nmarket value than Harvester—$747 million versus $710 million.\nThis is the more amazing when one reflects that Harvester had 17\ntimes the stock capital of Flavors and 27 times the annual sales. In\n*Graham is alerting readers to a form of the “gambler’s fallacy,” in which\ninvestors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price purely because\nit is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more likely to turn up heads\nafter landing on tails for nine times in a row, so an overvalued stock (or stock\nmarket!) can stay overvalued for a surprisingly long time. That makes short-\nselling, or betting that stocks will drop, too risky for mere mortals.\n†International Harvester was the heir to McCormick Harvesting Machine\nCo., the manufacturer of the McCormick reaper that helped make the mid-\nwestern states the “breadbasket of the world.” But International Harvester\nfell on hard times in the 1970s and, in 1985, sold its farm-equipment busi-\nness to Tenneco. After changing its name to Navistar, the remaining com-\npany was booted from the Dow in 1991 (although it remains a member of\nthe S & P 500 index). International Flavors & Fragrances, also a constituent\nof the S & P 500, had a total stock-market value of $3 billion in early 2003,\nversus $1.6 billion for Navistar.\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 459\nTABLE 18-5.

How did these extraordinary\ndisparities develop? The answer lies in the two magic words: prof-\nitability and growth. Flavors made a remarkable showing in both\ncategories, while Harvester left everything to be desired.\nThe story is told in Table 18-5. Here we find Flavors with a sen-\nsational profit of 14.3% of sales (before income tax the figure was\n23%), compared with a mere 2.6% for Harvester. Similarly, Flavors\nwww.fx1618.com460 The Intelligent Investor\nhad earned 19.7% on its stock capital against an inadequate 5.5%\nearned by Harvester. In five years the net earnings of Flavors had\nnearly doubled, while those of Harvester practically stood still.\nBetween 1969 and 1959 the comparison makes similar reading.\nThese differences in performance produced a typical stock-market\ndivergence in valuation. Flavors sold in 1969 at 55 times its last\nreported earnings, and Harvester at only 10.7 times. Correspond-\ningly, Flavors was valued at 10.4 times its book value, while Har-\nvester was selling at a 41% discountfrom its net worth.\nCOMMENTANDCONCLUSIONS: The first thing to remark is that the\nmarket success of Flavors was based entirely on the development\nof its central business, and involved none of the corporate wheel-\ning and dealing, acquisition programs, top-heavy capitalization\nstructures, and other familiar Wall Street practices of recent years.\nThe company has stuck to its extremely profitable knitting, and\nthat is virtually its whole story. The record of Harvester raises an\nentirely different set of questions, but these too have nothing to do\nwith “high finance.” Why have so many great companies become\nrelatively unprofitable even during many years of general prosper-\nity? What is the advantage of doing more than $21⁄ billion of busi-\n2\nness if the enterprise cannot earn enough to justify the\nshareholders’ investment? It is not for us to prescribe the solution\nof this problem. But we insist that not only management but the\nrank and file of shareholders should be conscious that the problem\nexists and that it calls for the best brains and the best efforts possi-\nble to deal with it.* From the standpoint of common-stock selec-\ntion, neither issue would have met our standards of sound,\nreasonably attractive, and moderately priced investment. Flavors\nwas a typical brilliantly successful but lavishly valued company;\n*For more of Graham’s thoughts on shareholder activism, see the commen-\ntary on Chapter 19. In criticizing Harvester for its refusal to maximize share-\nholder value, Graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of the company’s\nfuture management. In 2001, a majority of shareholders voted to remove\nNavistar’s restrictions against outside takeover bids—but the board of direc-\ntors simply refused to implement the shareholders’ wishes. It’s remarkable\nthat an antidemocratic tendency in the culture of some companies can\nendure for decades.\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 461\nHarvester’s showing was too mediocre to make it really attractive\neven at its discount price. (Undoubtedly there were better values\navailable in the reasonably priced class.)\nSEQUEL TO 1971: The low price of Harvester at the end of 1969\nprotected it from a large further decline in the bad break of 1970. It\nlost only 10% more. Flavors proved more vulnerable and declined\nto 45, a loss of 30%. In the subsequent recovery both advanced,\nwell above their 1969 close, but Harvester soon fell back to the 25\nlevel.\nPair 6: McGraw Edison (public utility and equipment;\nhousewares) McGraw-Hill, Inc. (books, films, instruction\nsystems; magazine and newspaper publishers; information\nservices)\nThis pair with so similar names—which at times we shall call\nEdison and Hill—are two large and successful enterprises in vastly\ndifferent fields. We have chosen December 31, 1968, as the date of\nour comparison, developed in Table 18-6. The issues were selling at\nabout the same price, but because of Hill’s larger capitalization it\nwas valued at about twice the total figure of the other. This differ-\nence should appear somewhat surprising, since Edison had about\n50% higher sales and one-quarter larger net earnings. As a result,\nwe find that the key ratio—the multiplier of earnings—was more\nthan twice as great for Hill as for Edison. This phenomenon seems\nexplicable chiefly by the persistence of a strong enthusiasm and\npartiality exhibited by the market toward shares of book-\npublishing companies, several of which had been introduced to\npublic trading in the later 1960s.*\nActually, by the end of 1968 it was evident that this enthusiasm\nhad been overdone. The Hill shares had sold at 56 in 1967, more\nthan 40 times the just-reported record earnings for 1966. But a small\ndecline had appeared in 1967 and a further decline in 1968. Thus the\ncurrent high multiplier of 35 was being applied to a company that\n*McGraw-Hill remains a publicly-traded company that owns, among other\noperations, BusinessWeek magazine and Standard & Poor’s Corp.\nMcGraw–Edison is now a division of Cooper Industries.\nwww.fx1618.com462 The Intelligent Investor\nTABLE 18-6.

In the May 1970 debacle its price suffered a devas-\ntating break to 10—less than a fifth of the figure two years before. It\nhad a good recovery thereafter, but the high of 24 in May 1971 was\nstill only 60% of the 1968 closing price. McGraw Edison gave a bet-\nter account of itself—declining to 22 in 1970 and recovering fully to\n411⁄ in May 1971.*\n2\nMcGraw-Hill continues to be a strong and prosperous company.\nBut its price history exemplifies—as do so many other cases—the\nspeculative hazards in such stocks created by Wall Street through\nits undisciplined waves of optimism and pessimism.\nPair 7: National General Corp. (a large conglomerate) and\nNational Presto Industries (diverse electric appliances,\nordnance)\nThese two companies invite comparison chiefly because they\nare so different. Let us call them “General” and “Presto.” We have\nselected the end of 1968 for our study, because the write-offs taken\nby General in 1969 made the figures for that year too ambiguous.\nThe full flavor of General’s far-flung activities could not be savored\nthe year before, but it was already conglomerate enough for\nanyone’s taste. The condensed description in the Stock Guide read\n“Nation-wide theatre chain; motion picture and TV production,\nsavings and loan assn., book publishing.” To which could be\nadded, then or later, “insurance, investment banking, records,\nmusic publishing, computerized services, real estate—and 35% of\nPerformance Systems Inc. (name recently changed from Minnie\nPearl’s Chicken System Inc.).” Presto had also followed a diversifi-\ncation program, but in comparison with General it was modest\nindeed. Starting as the leading maker of pressure cookers, it had\nbranched out into various other household and electric appliances.\nQuite differently, also, it took on a number of ordnance contracts\nfor the U.S. government.\n*In “the May 1970 debacle” that Graham refers to, the U.S. stock market\nlost 5.5%. From the end of March to the end of June 1970, the S & P 500\nindexw lowst 1w9.%fx o1f it6s 1va8lu.ec, oonme of the worst three-month returns on record.464 The Intelligent Investor\nOur Table 18-7 summarizes the showing of the companies at the\nend of 1968. The capital structure of Presto was as simple as it\ncould be—nothing but 1,478,000 shares of common stock, selling in\nthe market for $58 million. Contrastingly, General had more than\ntwice as many shares of common, plus an issue of convertible pre-\nferred, plus three issues of stock warrants calling for a huge\namount of common, plus a towering convertible bond issue (just\ngiven in exchange for stock of an insurance company), plus a\ngoodly sum of nonconvertible bonds. All this added up to a market\ncapitalization of $534 million, not counting an impending issue of\nconvertible bonds, and $750 million, including such issue. Despite\nNational General’s enormously greater capitalization, it had actu-\nally done considerably less gross business than Presto in their fiscal\nyears, and it had shown only 75% of Presto’s net income.\nThe determination of the true market valueof General’s common-\nstock capitalization presents an interesting problem for security\nanalysts and has important implications for anyone interested in\nthe stock on any basis more serious than outright gambling. The\nrelatively small $41⁄ convertible preferred can be readily taken care\n2\nof by assuming its conversion into common, when the latter sells at\na suitable market level. This we have done in Table 18-7. But the\nwarrants require different treatment. In calculating the “full dilu-\ntion” basis the company assumes exercise of all the warrants, and\nthe application of the proceeds to the retirement of debt, plus use of\nthe balance to buy in common at the market. These assumptions\nactually produced virtually no effect on the earnings per share in\ncalendar 1968—which were reported as $1.51 both before and after\nallowance for dilution. We consider this treatment illogical and\nunrealistic. As we see it, the warrants represent a part of the “com-\nmon-stock package” and their market value is part of the “effective\nmarket value” of the common-stock part of the capital. (See our\ndiscussion of this point on p. 415 above.) This simple technique of\nadding the market price of the warrants to that of the common has\na radical effect on the showing of National General at the end of\n1968, as appears from the calculation in Table 18-7. In fact the “true\nmarket price” of the common stock turns out to be more than twice\nthe quoted figure. Hence the true multiplier of the 1968 earnings is\nmore than doubled—to the inherently absurd figure of 69 times.\nThe total market value of the “common-stock equivalents” then\nwww.fx1618.comAComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies 465\nTABLE 18-7.

One is moved to ask how could Presto\npossibly be valued at only 6.9 times its current earnings when the\nmultiplier for General was nearly 10 times as great. All the ratios of\nPresto are quite satisfactory—the growth figure suspiciously so, in\nfact. By that we mean that the company was undoubtedly benefit-\ning considerably from its war work, and the shareholders should\nbe prepared for some falling off in profits under peacetime condi-\ntions. But, on balance, Presto met all the requirements of a sound\nand reasonably priced investment, while General had all the ear-\nmarks of a typical “conglomerate” of the late 1960s vintage, full of\ncorporate gadgets and grandiose gestures, but lacking in substan-\ntial values behind the market quotations.\nSEQUEL: General continued its diversification policy in 1969, with\nsome increase in its debt. But it took a whopping write-off of mil-\nlions, chiefly in the value of its investment in the Minnie Pearl\nChicken deal. The final figures showed a loss of $72 million before\ntax credit and $46.4 million after tax credit. The price of the shares\nfell to 161⁄ in 1969 and as low as 9 in 1970 (only 15% of its 1968 high\n2\nof 60). Earnings for 1970 were reported as $2.33 per share diluted,\nand the price recovered to 281⁄ in 1971. National Presto increased its\n2\nper-share earnings somewhat in both 1969 and 1970, marking 10\nyears of uninterrupted growth of profits. Nonetheless its price\ndeclined to 211⁄ in the 1970 debacle. This was an interesting figure,\n2\nsince it was less than four times the last reported earnings, and less\nthan the net current assets available for the stock at the time. Late in\n1971 we find the price of National Presto 60% higher, at 34, but the\nratios are still startling. The enlarged working capital is still about\nequal to the current price, which in turn is only 51⁄ times the last\n2\nreported earnings. If the investor could now find ten such issues, for\ndiversification, he could be confident of satisfactory results.*\n*National Presto remains a publicly-traded company. National General was\nacquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate, American Financial\nGroup, which at various times has had interests in cable television, banking,\nreal estate, mutual funds, insurance, and bananas.

During the past decade it adopted a\npolicy of diversification in what seems a rather outlandish form.\nFor on the one hand it has an extraordinarily large number of sub-\nsidiary companies (at least 24), making an astonishing variety of\nproducts, but on the other hand the entire conglomeration adds up\nto mighty small potatoes by usual Wall Street standards.\nThe earnings developments in Whiting are rather characteristic\nof our business concerns. The figures show steady and rather spec-\ntacular growth from 41 cents a share in 1960 to $3.63 in 1968. But\nthey carried no assurance that such growth must continue indefi-\nnitely. The subsequent decline to only $1.77 for the 12 months\nended January 1971 may have reflected nothing more than the\nslowing down of the general economy. But the stock price reacted\nin severe fashion, falling about 60% from its 1968 high (431⁄) to the\n2\nclose of 1969. Our analysis would indicate that the shares repre-\nsented a sound and attractive secondary-issue investment—suit-\nable for the enterprising investor as part of a group of such\ncommitments.\nSEQUEL: Willcox & Gibbs showed a small operating loss for 1970.\nIts price declined drastically to a low of 41⁄, recovering in typical\n2\nfashion to 91⁄ in February 1971. It would be hard to justify that price\n2\nstatistically. Whiting had a relatively small decline, to 163⁄ in 1970.\n4\n(At that price it was selling at just about the current assets alone\navailable for the shares). Its earnings held at $1.85 per share to July\n1971. In early 1971 the price advanced to 241⁄, which seemed rea-\n2\nsonable enough but no longer a “bargain” by our standards.*\nGeneral Observations\nThe issues used in these comparisons were selected with some\nmalice aforethought, and thus they cannot be said to present a ran-\ndom cross-section of the common-stock list.

Whether the specific differentials in price/earnings ratios\nare “justified” by the facts—or will be vindicated by future devel-\nopments—cannot be answered with confidence. On the other hand\nwe do have quite a few instances here in which a worthwhile judg-\nment can be reached. These include virtually all the cases where\nthere has been great market activity in companies of questionable\nunderlying soundness. Such stocks not only were speculative—\nwhich means inherently risky—but a good deal of the time they\nwere and are obviously overvalued. Other issues appeared to be\nworth more than their price, being affected by the opposite sort of\nmarket attitude—which we might call “underspeculation”—or by\nundue pessimism because of a shrinkage in earnings.\nIn Table 18-9 we provide some data on the price fluctuations of\nthe issues covered in this chapter.

Cisco,\nwhich makes equipment that directs data over the Internet, first sold\nits shares to the public only 10 years earlier. Had you bought Cisco’s\nstock in the initial offering and kept it, you would have earned a gain\nresembling a typographical error made by a madman: 103,697%, or a\n217% average annual return. Over its previous four fiscal quarters,\nCisco had generated $14.9 billion in revenues and $2.5 billion in\nearnings. The stock was trading at 219 times Cisco’s net income, one\nof the highest price/earnings ratios ever accorded to a large company.\nThen there was Sysco Corp., which supplies food to institutional\nwww.fx1618.com\n473474 Commentary on Chapter 18\nkitchens and had been publicly traded for 30 years. Over its last four\nquarters, Sysco served up $17.7 billion in revenues—almost 20%\nmore than Cisco—but “only” $457 million in net income. With a market\nvalue of $11.7 billion, Sysco’s shares traded at 26 times earnings,\nwell below the market’s average P/E ratio of 31.\nA word-association game with a typical investor might have gone\nlike this.\nQ: What are the first things that pop into your head when I say\nCisco Systems?\nA: The Internet...the industry of the future...great stock...hot\nstock...Can I please buy some before it goes up even more?\nQ: And what about Sysco Corp.?\nA: Delivery trucks...succotash...Sloppy Joes...shepherd’s\npie...school lunches...hospital food...no thanks, I’m not hungry\nanymore.\nIt’s well established that people often assign a mental value to\nstocks based largely on the emotional imagery that companies evoke.1\nBut the intelligent investor always digs deeper. Here’s what a skeptical\nlook at Cisco and Sysco’s financial statements would have turned up:\n• Much of Cisco’s growth in revenues and earnings came from\nacquisitions. Since September alone, Cisco had ponied up $10.2\nbillion to buy 11 other firms. How could so many companies be\nmashed together so quickly?2 Also, roughly a third of Cisco’s\n1Ask yourself which company’s stock would be likely to rise more: one that\ndiscovered a cure for a rare cancer, or one that discovered a new way to\ndispose of a common kind of garbage.

And Cisco had gained $5.8 billion\nselling “investments,” then bought $6 billion more. Was it an Inter-\nnet company or a mutual fund? What if those “investments”\nstopped going up?\n• Sysco had also acquired several companies over the same\nperiod—but paid only about $130 million. Stock options for\nSysco’s insiders totaled only 1.5% of shares outstanding, versus\n6.9% at Cisco. If insiders cashed their options, Sysco’s earnings\nper share would be diluted much less than Cisco’s. And Sysco\nhad raised its quarterly dividend from nine cents a share to 10;\nCisco paid no dividend.\nFinally, as Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel pointed out, no\ncompany as big as Cisco had ever been able to grow fast enough to\njustify a price/earnings ratio above 60—let alone a P/E ratio over 200.3\nOnce a company becomes a giant, its growth must slow down—or it\nwill end up eating the entire world. The great American satirist\nAmbrose Bierce coined the word “incompossible” to describe two\nthings that are conceivable separately but cannot exist together. A\ncompany can be a giant, or it can deserve a giant P/E ratio, but both\ntogether are incompossible.\nThe wheels soon came off the Cisco juggernaut. First, in 2001,\ncame a $1.2 billion charge to “restructure” some of those acquisi-\ntions. Over the next two years, $1.3 billion in losses on those “invest-\nments” leaked out. From 2000 through 2002, Cisco’s stock lost\nthree-quarters of its value. Sysco, meanwhile, kept dishing out profits,\nand the stock gained 56% over the same period (see Figure 18-1).\nPAIR 2: YAHOO! AND YUM!\nOn November 30, 1999, Yahoo! Inc.’s stock closed at $212.75, up\n79.6% since the year began. By December 7, the stock was at $348—\n3Jeremy Siegel, “Big-Cap Tech Stocks are a Sucker’s Bet,” Wall Street\nJournal,March 14, 2000 (available at www.jeremysiegel.com).\nwww.fx1618.com476 Commentary on Chapter 18\nFIGURE 18-1 Cisco vs. Sysco\n2000 2001 2002\nCisco\nTotal return (%) –28.6 –52.7 –27.7\nNet earnings ($ millions) 2,668 –1,014 1,893\nSysco\nTotal return (%) 53.5 –11.7 15.5\nNet earnings ($ millions) 446 597 680\nNote: Total returns for calendar year; net earnings for fiscal year.\nSource: www.morningstar.com\na 63.6% gain in five trading days. Yahoo! kept whooping along\nthrough year-end, closing at $432.687 on December 31. In a single\nmonth, the stock had more than doubled, gaining roughly $58 billion\nto reach a total market value of $114 billion.4\nIn the previous four quarters, Yahoo! had racked up $433 million in\nrevenues and $34.9 million in net income. So Yahoo!’s stock was now\npriced at 263 times revenues and 3,264 times earnings. (Remember\nthat a P/E ratio much above 25 made Graham grimace!)5\nWhy was Yahoo! screaming upward? After the market closed on\nNovember 30, Standard & Poor’s announced that it would add Yahoo!\nto its S & P 500 index as of December 7. That would make Yahoo! a\ncompulsory holding for index funds and other big investors—and that\nsudden rise in demand was sure to drive the stock even higher, at\nleast temporarily. With some 90% of Yahoo!’s stock locked up in the\nhands of employees, venture-capital firms, and other restricted hold-\ners, just a fraction of its shares could trade. So thousands of people\nbought the stock only because they knew other people would have to\nbuy it—and price was no object.\n4Yahoo!’s stock split two-for-one in February 2000; the share prices given\nhere are not adjusted for that split in order to show the levels the stock actu-\nally traded at. But Yahoo!’s percentage return and market value, as cited\nhere, do reflect the split.\n5Counting the effect of acquisitions, Yahoo!’s revenues were $464 million.\nGraham criticizes high P/E ratios in (among other places) Chapters 7 and 11.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 18 477\nMeanwhile, Yum! went begging. A former division of PepsiCo that\nruns thousands of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell\neateries, Yum! had produced $8 billion in revenues over the previous\nfour quarters, on which it earned $633 million—making it more than 17\ntimes Yahoo!’s size. Yet Yum!’s stock-market value at year-end 1999\nwas only $5.9 billion, or 1/19 of Yahoo!’s capitalization. At that price,\nYum!’s stock was selling at just over nine times its earnings and only\n73% of its revenues.6\nAs Graham liked to say, in the short run the market is a voting\nmachine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine. Yahoo! won the\nshort-term popularity contest. But in the end, it’s earnings that matter—\nand Yahoo! barely had any. Once the market stopped voting and\nstarted weighing, the scales tipped toward Yum! Its stock rose 25.4%\nfrom 2000 through 2002, while Yahoo!’s lost 92.4% cumulatively:\nFIGURE 18-2 Yahoo! vs. Yum!\n2000 2001 2002\nYahoo!\nTotal return (%) –86.1 –41.0 –7.8\nNet earnings ($ millions) 71 –93 43\nYum!\nTotal return (%) –14.6 49.1 –1.5\nNet earnings ($ millions) 413 492 583\nNotes: Total returns for calendar year; net earnings for fiscal year.

In its first annual report, the company (which\n6Yum! was then known as Tricon Global Restaurants, Inc., although its\nticker symbol was YUM. The company changed its name officially to Yum!\nBrands, Inc. in May 2002.\nwww.fx1618.com478 Commentary on Chapter 18\ndesigns Internet “exchanges” for corporate purchasing departments)\nshowed assets of just $385 million and reported a net loss of $63 mil-\nlion on only $34 million in total revenues. The stock of this minuscule\ncompany had risen nearly 900% since its IPO, hitting a total market\ncapitalization of $15 billion. Was it overpriced? “Yes, we have a big\nmarket cap,” Commerce One’s chief executive, Mark Hoffman,\nshrugged in an interview. “But we have a big market to play in. We’re\nseeing incredible demand....Analysts expect us to make $140 mil-\nlion in revenue this year. And in the past we have exceeded expecta-\ntions.”\nTwo things jump out from Hoffman’s answer:\n• Since Commerce One was already losing $2 on every dollar in\nsales, if it quadrupled its revenues (as “analysts expect”), wouldn’t\nit lose money even more massively?\n• How could Commerce One have exceeded expectations “in the\npast”?Whatpast?\nAsked whether his company would ever turn a profit, Hoffman was\nready: “There is no question we can turn this into a profitable busi-\nness. We plan on becoming profitable in the fourth quarter of 2001, a\nyear analysts see us making over $250 million in revenues.”\nThere come those analysts again! “I like Commerce One at these\nlevels because it’s growing faster than Ariba [a close competitor\nwhose stock was also trading at around 400 times revenues],” said\nJeanette Sing, an analyst at the Wasserstein Perella investment bank.\n“If these growth rates continue, Commerce One will be trading at 60\nto 70 times sales in 2001.” (In other words, I can name a stock that’s\nmore overpriced than Commerce One, so Commerce One is cheap.)7\nAt the other extreme was Capital One Financial Corp., an issuer of\nMasterCard and Visa credit cards. From July 1999, to May 2000, its\nstock lost 21.5%. Yet Capital One had $12 billion in total assets and\nearned $363 million in 1999, up 32% from the year before. With a\nmarket value of about $7.3 billion, the stock sold at 20 times Capital\nOne’s net earnings. All might not be well at Capital One—the company\nhad barely raised its reserves for loans that might go bad, even though\n7See “CEO Speaks” and “The Bottom Line,” Money,May 2000, pp. 42–44.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 18 479\ndefault rates tend to jump in a recession—but its stock price reflected\nat least some risk of potential trouble.\nWhat happened next? In 2001, Commerce One generated $409\nmillion in revenues. Unfortunately, it ran a net loss of $2.6 billion—or\n$10.30 of red ink per share—on those revenues. Capital One, on the\nother hand, earned nearly $2 billion in net income in 2000 through\n2002. Its stock lost 38% in those three years—no worse than the stock\nmarket as a whole. Commerce One, however, lost 99.7% of its value.8\nInstead of listening to Hoffman and his lapdog analysts, traders\nshould have heeded the honest warning in Commerce One’s annual\nreport for 1999: “We have never been profitable. We expect to incur\nnet losses for the foreseeable future and we may never be profitable.”\nPAIR 4: PALM AND 3COM\nOn March 2, 2000, the data-networking company 3Com Corp. sold\n5% of its Palm, Inc. subsidiary to the public. The remaining 95% of\nPalm’s stock would be spun off to 3Com’s shareholders in the next\nfew months; for each share of 3Com they held, investors would\nreceive 1.525 shares of Palm.\nSo there were two ways you could get 100 shares of Palm: By try-\ning to elbow your way into the IPO, or by buying 66 shares of 3Com\nand waiting until the parent company distributed the rest of the Palm\nstock. Getting one-and-a-half shares of Palm for each 3Com share,\nyou’d end up with 100 shares of the new company—and you’d still\nhave 66 shares of 3Com.\nBut who wanted to wait a few months? While 3Com was struggling\nagainst giant rivals like Cisco, Palm was a leader in the hot “space” of\nhandheld digital organizers. So Palm’s stock shot up from its offering price\nof $38 to close at $95.06, a 150% first-day return. That valued Palm at\nmore than 1,350 times its earnings over the previous 12 months.\nThat same day, 3Com’s share price dropped from $104.13 to\n$81.81. Where should 3Com have closed that day, given the price of\nPalm? The arithmetic is easy:\n8In early 2003, Capital One’s chief financial officer resigned after securities\nregulators revealed that they might charge him with violations of laws\nagainst insider trading.\nwww.fx1618.com480 Commentary on Chapter 18\n• each 3Com share was entitled to receive 1.525 shares of Palm\n• each share of Palm closed at $95.06\n• 1.525(cid:1)$95.06 = $144.97\nThat’s what each 3Com share was worth based on its stake in\nPalm alone. Thus, at $81.81, traders were saying that all of 3Com’s\nother businesses combined were worth a negative $63.16 per share,\nor a total of minus $22 billion! Rarely in history has any stock been\npriced more stupidly.9\nBut there was a catch: Just as 3Com wasn’t really worth minus\n$22 billion, Palm wasn’t really worth over 1,350 times earnings. By\nthe end of 2002, both stocks were hurting in the high-tech recession,\nbut it was Palm’s shareholders who really got smacked—because they\nabandoned all common sense when they bought in the first place:\nPalm’s Down\n14,000\n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\n6,000\n4,000\n$2,576\n2,000\n0 $83\n3/2/00 6/2/00 9/2/00 12/2/00 3/2/01 6/2/01 9/2/01 12/2/01 3/2/02 6/2/02 9/2/02 12/2/02\nDates\ntnemtsevni\n000,01$\nfo\neulaV\nFIGURE 18-3\nPalm\n3Com\nSource: www.morningstar.com\n9For a more advanced look at this bizarre event, see Owen A.

The company, an “Internet incubator,” financed and acquired\nstart-up firms in a variety of online businesses—among them such early\nstars as theglobe.com and Lycos.10\nIn fiscal year 1998, as its stock rose from 98 cents to $8.52,\nCMGIspent $53.8 million acquiring whole or partial stakes in Internet\ncompanies. In fiscal year 1999, as its stock shot from $8.52 to\n$46.09, CMGI shelled out $104.7 million. And in the last five months\nof 1999, as its shares zoomed up to $138.44, CMGI spent $4.1 bil-\nlion on acquisitions. Virtually all the “money” was CMGI’s own pri-\nvately-minted currency: its common stock, now valued at a total of\nmore than $40 billion.\nIt was a kind of magical money merry-go-round. The higher CMGI’s\nown stock went, the more it could afford to buy. The more CMGI\ncould afford to buy, the higher its stock went. First stocks would go up\non the rumor that CMGI might buy them; then, once CMGI acquired\nthem, its own stock would go up because it owned them. No one\ncared that CMGI had lost $127 million on its operations in the latest\nfiscal year.\nDown in Webster, Massachusetts, less than 70 miles southwest of\nCMGI’s headquarters in Andover, sits the main office of Commerce\nGroup, Inc. CGI was everything CMGI was not: Offering automobile\ninsurance, mainly to drivers in Massachusetts, it was a cold stock in an\nold industry. Its shares lost 23% in 1999—although its net income, at\n$89 million, ended up falling only 7% below 1998’s level. CGI even\npaid a dividend of more than 4% (CMGI paid none). With a total mar-\nket value of $870 million, CGI stock was trading at less than 10 times\nwhat the company would earn for 1999.\nAnd then, quite suddenly, everything went into reverse. CMGI’s\nmagical money merry-go-round screeched to a halt: Its dot-com\n10CMGIbegan corporate life as College Marketing Group, which sold infor-\nmation about college professors and courses to academic publishers—a\nbusiness that bore a faint but disturbing similarity to National Student Mar-\nketing, discussed by Graham on p. 235.\nwww.fx1618.com482 Commentary on Chapter 18\nstocks stopped rising in price, then went straight down. No longer\nable to sell them for a profit, CMGI had to take their loss in value as a\nhit to its earnings. The company lost $1.4 billion in 2000, $5.5 billion\nin 2001, and nearly $500 million more in 2002. Its stock went from\n$163.22 at the beginning of 2000 to 98 cents by year-end 2002—a\nloss of 99.4%. Boring old CGI, however, kept cranking out steady\nearnings, and its stock rose 8.5% in 2000, 43.6% in 2001, and 2.7%\nin 2002—a 60% cumulative gain.\nPAIR 6: BALL AND STRYKER\nBetween July 9 and July 23, 2002, Ball Corp.’s stock dropped from\n$43.69 to $33.48—a loss of 24% that left the company with a stock-\nmarket value of $1.9 billion. Over the same two weeks, Stryker Corp.’s\nshares fell from $49.55 to $45.60, an 8% drop that left Strkyer valued\nat a total of $9 billion.\nWhat had made these two companies worth so much less in so\nshort a time? Stryker, which manufactures orthopedic implants and\nsurgical equipment, issued only one press release during those two\nweeks. On July 16, Stryker announced that its sales grew 15% to\n$734 million in the second quarter, while earnings jumped 31% to\n$86 million. The stock rose 7% the next day, then rolled right back\ndownhill.\nBall, the original maker of the famous “Ball Jars” used for canning\nfruits and vegetables, now makes metal and plastic packaging for\nindustrial customers. Ball issued no press releases at all during those\ntwo weeks. On July 25, however, Ball reported that it had earned $50\nmillion on sales of $1 billion in the second quarter—a 61% rise in net\nincome over the same period one year earlier. That brought its earn-\nings over the trailing four quarters to $152 million, so the stock was\ntrading at just 12.5 times Ball’s earnings. And, with a book value of\n$1.1 billion, you could buy the stock for 1.7 times what the company’s\ntangible assets were worth. (Ball did, however, have just over $900\nmillion in debt.)\nStryker was in a different league. Over the last four quarters, the\ncompany had generated $301 million in net income. Stryker’s book\nvalue was $570 million. So the company was trading at fat multiples of\n30times its earnings over the past 12 months and nearly 16 times its\nbook value.

And in 2001, Stryker had spent $142 million\non research and development to lay the groundwork for future growth.\nWhat, then, had pounded these two stocks down? Between July 9\nand July 23, 2002, as WorldCom keeled over into bankruptcy, the Dow\nJones Industrial Average fell from 9096.09 to 7702.34, a 15.3%\nplunge. The good news at Ball and Stryker got lost in the bad headlines\nand falling markets, which took these two stocks down with them.\nAlthough Ball ended up priced far more cheaply than Stryker, the\nlesson here is not that Ball was a steal and Stryker was a wild pitch.\nInstead, the intelligent investor should recognize that market panics\ncan create great prices for good companies (like Ball) and good\nprices for great companies (like Stryker). Ball finished 2002 at $51.19\na share, up 53% from its July low; Stryker ended the year at $67.12,\nup 47%. Every once in a while, value and growth stocks alike go on\nsale. Which choice you prefer depends largely on your own personal-\nity, but bargains can be had on either side of the plate.\nPAIR 7: NORTEL AND NORTEK\nThe 1999 annual report for Nortel Networks, the fiber-optic equipment\ncompany, boasted that it was “a golden year financially.” As of Febru-\nary 2000, at a market value of more than $150 billion, Nortel’s stock\ntraded at 87 times the earnings that Wall Street’s analysts estimated\nthe company would produce in 2000.\nHow credible was that estimate? Nortel’s accounts receivable—\nsales to customers that had not yet paid the bill—had shot up by $1\nbillion in a year. The company said the rise “was driven by increased\nsales in the fourth quarter of 1999.” However, inventories had also bal-\nlooned by $1.2 billion—meaning that Nortel was producing equipment\neven faster than those “increased sales” could unload it.\nMeanwhile, Nortel’s “long-term receivables”—bills not yet paid for\nmulti-year contracts—jumped from $519 million to $1.4 billion. And Nor-\ntel was having a hard time controlling costs; its selling, general, and\nadministrative expense (or overhead) had risen from 17.6% of revenues\nin 1997 to 18.7% in 1999. All told, Nortel had lost $351 million in 1999.\nThen there was Nortek, Inc., which produces stuff at the dim end of\nthe glamour spectrum: vinyl siding, door chimes, exhaust fans, range\nhoods, trash compactors. In 1999, Nortek earned $49 million on $2\nbillion in net sales, up from $21 million in net income on $1.1 billion in\nsalesw inw 1w99.7f.x N1o6rte1k8’s. pcroofmit margin (net earnings as a percentage of484 Commentary on Chapter 18\nnet sales) had risen by almost a third from 1.9% to 2.5%. And Nortek\nhad cut overhead from 19.3% of revenues to 18.1%.\nTo be fair, much of Nortek’s expansion came from buying other\ncompanies, not from internal growth. What’s more, Nortek had $1 bil-\nlion in debt, a big load for a small firm. But, in February 2000, Nortek’s\nstock price—roughly five times its earnings in 1999—included a healthy\ndose of pessimism.\nOn the other hand, Nortel’s price—87 times the guesstimate of what it\nmight earn in the year to come—was a massive overdose of optimism.\nWhen all was said and done, instead of earning the $1.30 per share that\nanalysts had predicted, Nortel lost $1.17 per share in 2000. By the end\nof 2002, Nortel had bled more than $36 billion in red ink.\nNortek, on the other hand, earned $41.6 million in 2000, $8 million\nin 2001, and $55 million in the first nine months of 2002. Its stock\nwent from $28 a share to $45.75 by year-end 2002—a 63% gain. In\nJanuary 2003, Nortek’s managers took the company private, buying all\nthe stock from public investors at $46 per share. Nortel’s stock, mean-\nwhile, sank from $56.81 in February 2000, to $1.61 at year-end\n2002—a 97% loss.\nPAIR 8: RED HAT AND BROWN SHOE\nOn August 11, 1999, Red Hat, Inc., a developer of Linux software,\nsold stock to the public for the first time. Red Hat was red-hot; initially\noffered at $7, the shares opened for trading at $23 and closed at\n$26.031—a 272% gain.11In a single day, Red Hat’s stock had gone up\nmore than Brown Shoe’s had in the previous 18 years. By December\n9, Red Hat’s shares hit $143.13—up 1,944% in four months.\nBrown Shoe, meanwhile, had its laces tied together. Founded in\n1878, the company wholesales Buster Brown shoes and runs nearly\n1,300 footwear stores in the United States and Canada. Brown Shoe’s\nstock, at $17.50 a share on August 11, stumbled down to $14.31 by\nDecember 9. For all of 1999, Brown Shoe’s shares lost 17.6%.12\n11All stock prices for Red Hat are adjusted for its two-for-one stock split in\nJanuary 2000.\n12Ironically, 65 years earlier Graham had singled out Brown Shoe as one of\nthe most stable companies on the New York Stock Exchange. See the 1934\nedition owf Swecwuri.tyf xA1na6ly1sis8,.pc. 1o5m9.Commentary on Chapter 18 485\nBesides a cool name and a hot stock, what did Red Hat’s investors\nget? Over the nine months ending November 30, the company pro-\nduced $13 million in revenues, on which it ran a net loss of $9 mil-\nlion.13 Red Hat’s business was barely bigger than a street-corner\ndelicatessen—and a lot less lucrative. But traders, inflamed by the\nwords “software” and “Internet,” drove the total value of Red Hat’s\nshares to $21.3 billion by December 9.\nAnd Brown Shoe? Over the previous three quarters, the company\nhad produced $1.2 billion in net sales and $32 million in earnings.\nBrown Shoe had nearly $5 a share in cash and real estate; kids were\nstill buying Buster Brown shoes. Yet, that December 9, Brown Shoe’s\nstock had a total value of $261 million—barely 1/80 the size of Red\nHat even though Brown Shoe had 100 times Red Hat’s revenues. At\nthat price, Brown Shoe was valued at 7.6 times its annual earnings\nand less than one-quarter of its annual sales. Red Hat, on the other\nhand, had no profits at all, while its stock was selling at more than\n1,000 times its annual sales.\nRed Hat the company kept right on gushing red ink. Soon enough,\nthe stock did too. Brown Shoe, however, trudged out more profits—\nand so did its shareholders:\nFIGURE 18-4 Red Hat vs. Brown Shoe\n2000 2001 2002\nRed Hat\nTotal return (%) –94.1 13.6 –16.8\nNet earnings ($ millions) –43 -87 –140\nBrown Shoe\nTotal return (%) –4.6 28.2 49.5\nNet earnings ($ millions) 36 36 –4\nNote: Total returns for calendar year; net earnings for fiscal year.\nSource: www.morningstar.com\n13We use a nine-month period only because Red Hat’s 12-month results\ncould not be determined from its financial statements without including the\nresultws owf awcq.ufixsi1tio6ns1.8.com486 Commentary on Chapter 18\nWhat have we learned? The market scoffs at Graham’s principles\nin the short run, but they are always revalidated in the end. If you buy a\nstock purely because its price has been going up—instead of asking\nwhether the underlying company’s valueis increasing—then sooner or\nlater you will be extremely sorry. That’s not a likelihood. It is a certainty.\nwww.fx1618.comCHAPTER 19\nShareholders and Managements:\nDividend Policy\nE\nver since 1934 we have argued in our writings for a more intelli-\ngent and energetic attitude by shareholders toward their manage-\nments. We have asked them to take a generous attitude toward\nthose who are demonstrably doing a good job. We have asked\nthem also to demand clear and satisfying explanations when the\nresults appear to be worse than they should be, and to support\nmovements to improve or remove clearly unproductive manage-\nments. Shareholders are justified in raising questions as to the com-\npetence of the management when the results (1) are unsatisfactory\nin themselves, (2) are poorer than those obtained by other compa-\nnies that appear similarly situated, and (3) have resulted in an\nunsatisfactory market price of long duration.\nIn the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been accom-\nplished through intelligent action by the great body of sharehold-\ners. Asensible crusader—if there are any such—would take this as\na sign that he has been wasting his time, and that he had better\ngive up the fight. As it happens our cause has not been lost; it has\nbeen rescued by an extraneous development—known as take-\novers, or take-over bids.* We said in Chapter 8 that poor manage-\n*Ironically, takeovers began drying up shortly after Graham’s last revised\nedition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the absolute low\npoint of modern American industrial efficiency. Cars were “lemons,” televi-\nsions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the managers of many\npublicly-traded companies ignored both the present interests of their out-\nside shareholders and the future prospects of their own businesses. All of\nwww.fx1618.com\n487488 The Intelligent Investor\nments produce poor market prices. The low market prices, in turn,\nattract the attention of companies interested in diversifying their\noperations—and these are now legion. Innumerable such acquisi-\ntions have been accomplished by agreement with the existing man-\nagements, or else by accumulation of shares in the market and by\noffers made over the head of those in control. The price bid has\nusually been within the range of the value of the enterprise under\nreasonably competent management. Hence, in many cases, the\ninert public shareholder has been bailed out by the actions of “out-\nsiders”—who at times may be enterprising individuals or groups\nacting on their own.\nIt can be stated as a rule with very few exceptions that poor\nmanagements are not changed by action of the “public stockhold-\ners,” but only by the assertion of control by an individual or com-\npact group. This is happening often enough these days to put the\nmanagement, including the board of directors, of a typical publicly\ncontrolled company on notice that if its operating results and the\nresulting market price are highly unsatisfactory, it may become the\ntarget of a successful take-over move. As a consequence, boards of\ndirectors have probably become more alive than previously to their\nfundamental duty to see that their company has a satisfactory top\nmanagement. Many more changes of presidents have been seen in\nrecent years than formerly.\nNot all companies in the unsatisfactory class have benefited\nfrom such developments. Also, the change has often occurred after\na long period of bad results without remedial action, and has\ndepended on enough disappointed shareholders selling out at low\nprices to permit the energetic outsiders to acquire a controlling\nposition in the shares. But the idea that public shareholders could\nreally help themselves by supporting moves for improving man-\nagement and management policies has proved too quixotic to war-\nthis began to change in 1984, when independent oilman T. Boone Pickens\nlaunched a hostile takeover bid for Gulf Oil. Soon, fueled by junk-bond\nfinancing provided by Drexel Burnham Lambert, “corporate raiders” stalked\nthe landscape of corporate America, scaring long-sclerotic companies into\na new regimen of efficiency. While many of the companies involved in buy-\nouts and takeovers were ravaged, the rest of American business emerged\nboth leanwerw (wwhic.hf xw1as6 g1oo8d.)c aondm meaner (which sometimes was not).Shareholders and Managements 489\nrant further space in this book. Those individual shareholders who\nhave enough gumption to make their presence felt at annual meet-\nings—generally a completely futile performance—will not need\nour counsel on what points to raise with the managements. For\nothers the advice would probably be wasted. Nevertheless, let us\nclose this section with the plea that shareholders consider with an\nopen mind and with careful attention any proxy material sent them\nby fellow-shareholders who want to remedy an obviously unsatis-\nfactory management situation in the company.\nShareholders and Dividend Policy\nIn the past the dividend policy was a fairly frequent subject of\nargument between public, or “minority,” shareholders and man-\nagements. In general these shareholders wanted more liberal divi-\ndends, while the managements preferred to keep the earnings in\nthe business “to strengthen the company.” They asked the share-\nholders to sacrifice their present interests for the good of the enter-\nprise and for their own future long-term benefit. But in recent years\nthe attitude of investors toward dividends has been undergoing a\ngradual but significant change. The basic argument now for paying\nsmall rather than liberal dividends is not that the company\n“needs” the money, but rather that it can use it to the shareholders’\ndirect and immediate advantage by retaining the funds for prof-\nitable expansion. Years ago it was typically the weak company that\nwas more or less forced to hold on to its profits, instead of paying\nout the usual 60% to 75% of them in dividends. The effect was\nalmost always adverse to the market price of the shares. Nowadays\nit is quite likely to be a strong and growing enterprise that deliber-\nately keeps down its dividend payments, with the approval of\ninvestors and speculators alike.*\nThere was always a strong theoretical case for reinvesting prof-\n*The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the 1990s,\nwhen it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less likely it\nwas to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The “payout\nratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies paid out as div-\nidends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35% to 40% by\nthe ewndw of wthe.f 1x91960s1. 8.com490 The Intelligent Investor\nits in the business where such retention could be counted on to\nproduce a goodly increase in earnings. But there were several\nstrong counter-arguments, such as: The profits “belong” to the\nshareholders, and they are entitled to have them paid out within\nthe limits of prudent management; many of the shareholders need\ntheir dividend income to live on; the earnings they receive in divi-\ndends are “real money,” while those retained in the company may\nor may not show up later as tangible values for the shareholders.\nThese counter-arguments were so compelling, in fact, that the stock\nmarket showed a persistent bias in favor of the liberal dividend\npayers as against the companies that paid no dividends or rela-\ntively small ones.1\nIn the last 20 years the “profitable reinvestment” theory has\nbeen gaining ground. The better the past record of growth, the\nreadier investors and speculators have become to accept a low-\npay-out policy. So much is this true that in many cases of growth\nfavorites the dividend rate—or even the absence of any dividend—\nhas seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price.*\nAstriking example of this development is found in the history\nof Texas Instruments, Incorporated. The price of its common stock\nrose from 5 in 1953 to 256 in 1960, while earnings were advancing\nfrom 43 cents to $3.91 per share and while no dividend of any kind\nwas paid. (In 1962 cash dividends were initiated, but by that year\nthe earnings had fallen to $2.14 and the price had shown a spectac-\nular drop to a low of 49.)\nAnother extreme illustration is provided by Superior Oil. In\n1948 the company reported earnings of $35.26 per share, paid $3 in\ndividends, and sold as high as 235. In 1953 the dividend was\nreduced to $1, but the high price was 660. In 1957 it paid no dividend\n*In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong advo-\ncates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back into the\nbusiness,” where they could earn higher returns than any outside share-\nholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it were paid out to him\nor her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never questioned the truth of this\npatronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or even realized that a company’s\ncash belongs to the shareholders, not its managers. See the commentary\non this chapter.\nwww.fx1618.comShareholders and Managements 491\nat all,and sold at 2,000! This unusual issue later declined to 795 in\n1962, when it earned $49.50 and paid $7.50.*\nInvestment sentiment is far from crystallized in this matter of\ndividend policy of growth companies. The conflicting views are\nwell illustrated by the cases of two of our very largest corpora-\ntions—American Telephone & Telegraph and International Busi-\nness Machines. American Tel. & Tel. came to be regarded as an\nissue with good growth possibilities, as shown by the fact that in\n1961 it sold at 25 times that year’s earnings. Nevertheless, the\ncompany’s cash dividend policy has remained an investment and\nspeculative consideration of first importance, its quotation making\nan active response to even rumorsof an impending increase in the\ndividend rate. On the other hand, comparatively little attention\nappears to have been paid to the cash dividend on IBM, which in\n1960 yielded only 0.5% at the high price of the year and 1.5% at the\nclose of 1970. (But in both cases stock splits have operated as a\npotent stock-market influence.)\nThe market’s appraisal of cash-dividend policy appears to be\ndeveloping in the following direction: Where prime emphasis is\nnot placed on growth the stock is rated as an “income issue,” and\nthe dividend rate retains its long-held importance as the prime\ndeterminant of market price. At the other extreme, stocks clearly\nrecognized to be in the rapid-growth category are valued primarily\nin terms of the expected growth rate over, say, the next decade, and\nthe cash-dividend rate is more or less left out of the reckoning.\nWhile the above statement may properly describe present ten-\ndencies, it is by no means a clear-cut guide to the situation in all\ncommon stocks, and perhaps not in the majority of them. For one\nthing, many companies occupy an intermediate position between\ngrowth and nongrowth enterprises. It is hard to say how much\nimportance should be ascribed to the growth factor in such cases,\nand the market’s view thereof may change radically from year to\nyear. Secondly, there seems to be something paradoxical about\n*Superior Oil’s stock price peaked at $2165 per share in 1959, when it\npaid a $4 dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced stock\nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange. Superior, controlled by the Keck\nfamily of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.\nwww.fx1618.com492 The Intelligent Investor\nrequiring the companies showing slower growth to be more liberal\nwith their cash dividends. For these are generally the less prosper-\nous concerns, and in the past the more prosperous the company the\ngreater was the expectation of both liberal and increasing pay-\nments.\nIt is our belief that shareholders should demand of their man-\nagements either a normal payout of earnings—on the order, say, of\ntwo-thirds—or else a clear-cut demonstration that the reinvested\nprofits have produced a satisfactory increase in per-share earnings.\nSuch a demonstration could ordinarily be made in the case of a rec-\nognized growth company. But in many other cases a low payout is\nclearly the cause of an average market price that is below fair\nvalue, and here the shareholders have every right to inquire and\nprobably to complain.\nA niggardly policy has often been imposed on a company\nbecause its financial position is relatively weak, and it has needed\nall or most of its earnings (plus depreciation charges) to pay debts\nand bolster its working-capital position. When this is so there is not\nmuch the shareholders can say about it—except perhaps to criticize\nthe management for permitting the company to fall into such an\nunsatisfactory financial position. However, dividends are some-\ntimes held down by relatively unprosperous companies for the\ndeclared purpose of expanding the business. We feel that such a\npolicy is illogical on its face, and should require both a complete\nexplanation and a convincing defense before the shareholders\nshould accept it. In terms of the past record there is no reason a pri-\nori to believe that the owners will benefit from expansion moves\nundertaken with their money by a business showing mediocre\nresults and continuing its old management.\nStock Dividends and Stock Splits\nIt is important that investors understand the essential difference\nbetween a stock dividend (properly so-called) and a stock split.\nThe latter represents a restatement of the common-stock struc-\nture—in a typical case by issuing two or three shares for one. The\nnew shares are not related to specific earnings reinvested in a spe-\ncific past period. Its purpose is to establish a lower market price for\nthe single shares, presumably because such lower price range\nwww.fx1618.comShareholders and Managements 493\nwould be more acceptable to old and new shareholders. A stock\nsplit may be carried out by what technically may be called a stock\ndividend, which involves a transfer of sums from earned surplus\nto capital account; or else by a change in par value, which does not\naffect the surplus account.*\nWhat we should call a proper stock dividendis one that is paid to\nshareholders to give them a tangible evidence or representation of\nspecific earnings which have been reinvested in the business for\ntheir account over some relatively short period in the recent past—\nsay, not more than the two preceding years. It is now approved\npractice to value such a stock dividend at the approximate value at\nthe time of declaration, and to transfer an amount equal to such\nvalue from earned surplus to capital accounts. Thus the amount of\na typical stock dividend is relatively small—in most cases not more\nthan 5%. In essence a stock dividend of this sort has the same over-\nall effect as the payment of an equivalent amount of cash out of\nearnings when accompanied by the sale of additional shares of like\ntotal value to the shareholders. However, a straight stock dividend\nhas an important tax advantage over the otherwise equivalent\ncombination of cash dividends with stock subscription rights,\nwhich is the almost standard practice for public-utility companies.\nThe New York Stock Exchange has set the figure of 25% as a\npractical dividing line between stock splits and stock dividends.\nThose of 25% or more need not be accompanied by the transfer of\ntheir market value from earned surplus to capital, and so forth.†\nSome companies, especially banks, still follow the old practice of\n*Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in value. In a\ntwo-for-one split, one share becomes two, each trading at half the former\nprice of the original single share; in a three-for-one split, one share becomes\nthree, each trading at a third of the former price; and so on. Only in very rare\ncases is a sum transferred “from earned surplus to capital account,” as in\nGraham’s day.\n†Rule 703 of the New York Stock Exchange governs stock splits and stock\ndividends. The NYSE now designates stock dividends of greater than 25%\nand less than 100% as “partial stock splits.” Unlike in Graham’s day, these\nstock dividends may now trigger the NYSE’s accounting requirement that\nthe amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained earnings.\nwww.fx1618.com494 The Intelligent Investor\ndeclaring any kind of stock dividend they please—e.g., one of 10%,\nnot related to recent earnings—and these instances maintain an\nundesirable confusion in the financial world.\nWe have long been a strong advocate of a systematic and clearly\nenunciated policy with respect to the payment of cash and stock\ndividends. Under such a policy, stock dividends are paid periodi-\ncally to capitalize all or a stated portion of the earnings reinvested\nin the business. Such a policy—covering 100% of the reinvested\nearnings—has been followed by Purex, Government Employees\nInsurance, and perhaps a few others.*\nStock dividends of all types seem to be disapproved of by most\nacademic writers on the subject. They insist that they are nothing\nbut pieces of paper, that they give the shareholders nothing they\ndid not have before, and that they entail needless expense and\ninconvenience.† On our side we consider this a completely doctri-\nnaire view, which fails to take into account the practical and\npsychological realities of investment. True, a periodic stock divi-\ndend—say of 5%—changes only the “form” of the owners’ invest-\nment. He has 105 shares in place of 100; but without the stock\ndividend the original 100 shares would have represented the same\n*This policy, already unusual in Graham’s day, is extremely rare today. In\n1936 and again in 1950, roughly half of all stocks on the NYSE paid a\nso-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had declined\nto less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See Harry DeAn-\ngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special Dividends and the\nEvolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial Economics,vol. 57, no.\n3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most plausible explanation for this\ndecline is that corporate managers became uncomfortable with the idea\nthat shareholders might interpret special dividends as a signal that future\nprofits might be low.\n†The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and Franco\nModigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valua-\ntion of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in Economics. Miller\nand Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were irrelevant, since an\ninvestor should not care whether his return comes through dividends and a\nrising stock price, or through a rising stock price alone, so long as the total\nreturn is the same in either case.\nwww.fx1618.comShareholders and Managements 495\nownership interest now embodied in his 105 shares. Nonetheless,\nthe change of form is actually one of real importance and value to\nhim. If he wishes to cash in his share of the reinvested profits he\ncan do so by selling the new certificate sent him, instead of having\nto break up his original certificate. He can count on receiving the\nsame cash-dividend rate on 105 shares as formerly on his 100\nshares; a 5% rise in the cash-dividend rate without the stock divi-\ndend would not be nearly as probable.*\nThe advantages of a periodic stock-dividend policy are most\nevident when it is compared with the usual practice of the public-\nutility companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking\nback a good part of this money from the shareholders by selling\nthem additional stock (through subscription rights).† As we men-\ntioned above, the shareholders would find themselves in exactly\nthe same position if they received stock dividends in lieu of the\npopular combination of cash dividends followed by stock sub-\nscriptions—except that they would save the income tax otherwise\npaid on the cash dividends. Those who need or wish the maximum\nannual cash income, with no additional stock, can get this result by\nselling their stock dividends, in the same way as they sell their sub-\nscription rights under present practice.\nThe aggregate amount of income tax that could be saved by sub-\nstituting stock dividends for the present stock-dividends-plus-\nsubscription-rights combination is enormous. We urge that this\n*Graham’s argument is no longer valid, and today’s investors can safely\nskip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry about “having\nto break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all shares now exist in elec-\ntronic rather than paper form. And when Graham says that a 5% increase in\na cash dividend on 100 shares is less “probable” than a constant dividend\non 105 shares, it’s unclear how he could even calculate that probability.\n†Subscription rights, often simply known as “rights,” are used less fre-\nquently than in Graham’s day. They confer upon an existing shareholder the\nright to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to market price. A share-\nholder who does not participate will end up owning proportionately less of\nthe company. Thus, as is the case with so many other things that go by the\nname of “rights,” some coercion is often involved.

C. Lichtenberg\nWHY DID GRAHAM THROW IN THE TOWEL?\nPerhaps no other part of The Intelligent Investorwas more drastically\nchanged by Graham than this. In the first edition, this chapter was one\nof a pair that together ran nearly 34 pages. That original section (“The\nInvestor as Business Owner”) dealt with shareholders’ voting rights,\nways of judging the quality of corporate management, and techniques\nfor detecting conflicts of interest between insiders and outside\ninvestors. By his last revised edition, however, Graham had pared the\nwhole discussion back to less than eight terse pages about dividends.\nWhy did Graham cut away more than three-quarters of his original\nargument? After decades of exhortation, he evidently had given up\nhope that investors would ever take any interest in monitoring the\nbehavior of corporate managers.\nBut the latest epidemic of scandal—allegations of managerial mis-\nbehavior, shady accounting, or tax maneuvers at major firms like AOL,\nEnron, Global Crossing, Sprint, Tyco, and WorldCom—is a stark\nreminder that Graham’s earlier warnings about the need for eternal\nvigilance are more vital than ever. Let’s bring them back and discuss\nthem in light of today’s events.\nTHEORY VERSUS PRACTICE\nGraham begins his original (1949) discussion of “The Investor as Busi-\nness Owner” by pointing out that, in theory,“the stockholders as a class\nare king. Acting as a majority they can hire and fire managements and\nbend them completely to their will.” But, in practice,says Graham,\nwww.fx1618.com\n497498 Commentary on Chapter 19\nthe shareholders are a complete washout. As a class they show nei-\nther intelligence nor alertness. They vote in sheeplike fashion for\nwhatever the management recommends and no matter how poor the\nmanagement’s record of accomplishment may be....The only way to\ninspire the average American shareholder to take any independently\nintelligent action would be by exploding a firecracker under him....\nWe cannot resist pointing out the paradoxical fact that Jesus seems\nto have been a more practical businessman than are American share-\nholders.1\nGraham wants you to realize something basic but incredibly pro-\nfound: When you buy a stock, you become an owner of the company.\nIts managers, all the way up to the CEO, work for you. Its board of\ndirectors must answer to you. Its cash belongs to you. Its businesses\nare your property. If you don’t like how your company is being man-\naged, you have the right to demand that the managers be fired, the\ndirectors be changed, or the property be sold. “Stockholders,”\ndeclares Graham, “should wake up.”2\n1Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper & Row, New York,\n1949), pp. 217, 219, 240. Graham explains his reference to Jesus this way:\n“In at least four parables in the Gospels there is reference to a highly critical\nrelationship between a man of wealth and those he puts in charge of his\nproperty. Most to the point are the words that “a certain rich man” speaks to\nhis steward or manager, who is accused of wasting his goods: ‘Give an\naccount of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer steward.’ (Luke,\n16:2).” Among the other parables Graham seems to have in mind is Matt.,\n25:15–28.\n2Benjamin Graham, “A Questionnaire on Stockholder-Management Rela-\ntionship,” The Analysts Journal,Fourth Quarter, 1947, p. 62. Graham points\nout that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional security ana-\nlysts and found that more than 95% of them believed that shareholders have\nthe right to call for a formal investigation of managers whose leadership\ndoes not enhance the value of the stock. Graham adds dryly that “such\naction is almost unheard of in practice.” This, he says, “highlights the wide\ngulf between what should happen and what does happen in shareholder-\nmanagement relationships.”\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 19 499\nTHE INTELLIGENT OWNER\nToday’s investors have forgotten Graham’s message. They put most of\ntheir effort into buying a stock, a little into selling it—but none into own-\ning it. “Certainly,” Graham reminds us, “there is just as much reason to\nexercise care and judgment in beingas in becominga stockholder.”3\nSo how should you, as an intelligent investor, go about being an\nintelligent owner? Graham starts by telling us that “there are just two\nbasic questions to which stockholders should turn their attention:\n1. Is the management reasonably efficient?\n2. Are the interests of the average outside shareholder receiving\nproper recognition?”4\nYou should judge the efficiency of management by comparing each\ncompany’s profitability, size, and competitiveness against similar firms\nin its industry. What if you conclude that the managers are no good?\nThen, urges Graham,\nA few of the more substantial stockholders should become convinced\nthat a change is needed and should be willing to work toward that\nend. Second, the rank and file of the stockholders should be open-\nminded enough to read the proxy material and to weigh the argu-\nments on both sides. They must at least be able to know when their\ncompany has been unsuccessful and be ready to demand more than\nartful platitudes as a vindication of the incumbent management. Third,\nit would be most helpful, when the figures clearly show that the\nresults are well below average, if it became the custom to call in out-\nside business engineers to pass upon the policies and competence\nof the management.5\n3Graham and Dodd, Security Analysis(1934 ed.), p. 508.\n4The Intelligent Investor,1949 edition, p. 218.\n51949 edition, p. 223. Graham adds that a proxy vote would be necessary\nto authorize an independent committee of outside shareholders to select\n“the engineering firm” that would submit its report to the shareholders, not\nto the board of directors. However, the company would bear the costs of\nthis project. Among the kinds of “engineering firms” (cont’d on p. 501)\nwww.fx1618.com500 Commentary on Chapter 19\nTHE ENRON END-RUN\nBackin 1999, Enron Corp. ranked seventh on the Fortune500\nlist of America’s top companies. The energy giant’s revenues,\nassets, and earnings were all rising like rockets.\nBut what if an investor had ignored the glamour and glittering\nnumbers—and had simply put Enron’s 1999 proxy statement\nunder the microscope of common sense? Under the heading\n“Certain Transactions,” the proxy disclosed that Enron’s chief\nfinancial officer, Andrew Fastow, was the “managing member”\nof two partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, that bought “energy and\ncommunications related investments.” And where was LJM1\nand LJM2 buying from? Why, where else but from Enron! The\nproxy reported that the partnerships had already bought $170\nmillion of assets from Enron—sometimes using money borrowed\nfrom Enron.\nThe intelligent investor would immediately have asked:\n• Did Enron’s directors approve this arrangement? (Yes, said\nthe proxy.)\n• Would Fastow get a piece of LJM’s profits? (Yes, said the\nproxy.)\n• As Enron’s chief financial officer, was Fastow obligated to act\nexclusively in the interests of Enron’s shareholders? (Of\ncourse.)\n• Was Fastow therefore duty-bound to maximize the price\nEnron obtained for any assets it sold? (Absolutely.)\n• But if LJM paid a high price for Enron’s assets, would that\nlower LJM’s potential profits—and Fastow’s personal\nincome? (Clearly.)\n• On the other hand, if LJM paid a low price, would that raise\nprofits for Fastow and his partnerships, but hurt Enron’s\nincome? (Clearly.)\n• Should Enron lend Fastow’s partnerships any money to buy\nassets from Enron that might generate a personal profit for\nFastow? (Say what?!)\n• Doesn’t all this constitute profoundly disturbing conflicts of\ninterest? (No other answer is even possible.)\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 19 501\n• What does this arrangement say about the judgment of the\ndirectors who approved it? (It says you should take your\ninvestment dollars elsewhere.)\nTwo clear lessons emerge from this disaster: Never dig so\ndeep into the numbers that you check your common sense at\nthe door, and always read the proxy statement before (and after)\nyou buy a stock.\nWhat is “proxy material” and why does Graham insist that you read\nit? In its proxy statement, which it sends to every shareholder, a com-\npany announces the agenda for its annual meeting and discloses\ndetails about the compensation and stock ownership of managers\nand directors, along with transactions between insiders and the com-\npany. Shareholders are asked to vote on which accounting firm should\naudit the books and who should serve on the board of directors. If you\nuse your common sense while reading the proxy, this document can\nbe like a canary in a coal mine—an early warning system signaling that\nsomething is wrong. (See the Enron sidebar above.)\nYet, on average, between a third and a half of all individual investors\ncannot be bothered to vote their proxies.6Do they even read them?\nUnderstanding and voting your proxy is as every bit as fundamental\n(cont’d from p. 499) Graham had in mind were money managers, rating agen-\ncies and organizations of security analysts. Today, investors could choose\nfrom among hundreds of consulting firms, restructuring advisers, and mem-\nbers of entities like the Risk Management Association.\n6Tabulations of voting results for 2002 by Georgeson Shareholder and\nADP’s Investor Communication Services, two leading firms that mail proxy\nsolicitations to investors, suggest response rates that average around 80%\nto 88% (including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their clients,\nwhich are automatically voted in favor of management unless the clients\nspecify otherwise). Thus the owners of between 12% and 20% of all shares\nare not voting their proxies. Since individuals own only 40% of U.S. shares\nby market value, and most institutional investors like pension funds and\ninsurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy issues, that means\nthat roughly a third of all individual investors are neglecting to vote.\nwww.fx1618.com502 Commentary on Chapter 19\nto being an intelligent investor as following the news and voting your\nconscience is to being a good citizen. It doesn’t matter whether you\nown 10% of a company or, with your piddling 100 shares, just\n1/10.000 of 1%. If you’ve never read the proxy of a stock you own,\nand the company goes bust, the only person you should blame is\nyourself. If you do read the proxy and see things that disturb you, then:\n• vote against every director to let them know you disapprove\n• attend the annual meeting and speak up for your rights\n• find an online message board devoted to the stock (like those at\nhttp://finance.yahoo.com) and rally other investors to join your\ncause.\nGraham had another idea that could benefit today’s investors:\n...there are advantages to be gained through the selection of one or\nmore professional and independent directors. These should be men\nof wide business experience who can turn a fresh and expert eye on\nthe problems of the enterprise....They should submit a separate\nannual report, addressed directly to the stockholders and containing\ntheir views on the major question which concerns the owners of the\nenterprise: “Is the business showing the results for the outside stock-\nholder which could be expected of it under proper management? If\nnot, why—and what should be done about it?7\nOne can only imagine the consternation that Graham’s proposal\nwould cause among the corporate cronies and golfing buddies who\nconstitute so many of today’s “independent” directors. (Let’s not sug-\ngest that it might send a shudder of fear down their spines, since most\nindependent directors do not appear to have a backbone.)\nWHOSE MONEY IS IT, ANYWAY?\nNow let’s look at Graham’s second criterion—whether management\nacts in the best interests of outside investors. Managers have always\ntold shareholders that they—the managers—know best what to do with\n71949 edition, p. 224.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 19 503\nthe company’s cash. Graham saw right through this managerial\nmalarkey:\nA company’s management may run the business well and yet not give\nthe outside stockholders the right results for them, because its effi-\nciency is confined to operations and does not extend to the best use\nof the capital. The objective of efficient operationis to produce at low\ncost and to find the most profitable articles to sell. Efficient finance\nrequires that the stockholders’ money be working in forms most suit-\nable to their interest. This is a question in which management, as such,\nhas little interest. Actually, it almost always wants as much capital from\nthe owners as it can possibly get, in order to minimize its own financial\nproblems. Thus the typical management will operate with more capital\nthan necessary, if the stockholders permit it—which they often do.8\nIn the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the managements of\nleading technology companies took this “Daddy-Knows-Best” attitude\nto new extremes. The argument went like this: Why should you\ndemand a dividend when we can invest that cash for you and turn it\ninto a rising share price? Just look at the way our stock has been\ngoing up—doesn’t that prove that we can turn your pennies into dollars\nbetter than you can?\nIncredibly, investors fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Daddy Knows\nBest became such gospel that, by 1999, only 3.7% of the companies\nthat first sold their stock to the public that year paid a dividend—down\nfrom an average of 72.1% of all IPOs in the 1960s.9Just look at how\n81949 edition, p. 233.\n9Eugene F.

While some compa-\nnies put their cash to good use, many more fell into two other cate-\ngories: those that simply wasted it, and those that piled it up far faster\nthan they could possibly spend it.\nIn the first group, Priceline.com wrote off $67 million in losses in\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 19 505\n2000 after launching goofy ventures into groceries and gasoline, while\nAmazon.com destroyed at least $233 million of its shareholders’\nwealth by “investing” in dot-bombs like Webvan and Ashford.com.10\nAnd the two biggest losses so far on record—JDS Uniphase’s $56 bil-\nlion in 2001 and AOL Time Warner’s $99 billion in 2002—occurred\nafter companies chose not to pay dividends but to merge with other\nfirms at a time when their shares were obscenely overvalued.11\nIn the second group, consider that by late 2001, Oracle Corp. had\npiled up $5 billion in cash. Cisco Systems had hoarded at least $7.5\nbillion. Microsoft had amassed a mountain of cash $38.2 billion high—\nand rising by an average of more than $2 million per hour.12 Just how\nrainy a day was Bill Gates expecting, anyway?\nSo the anecdotal evidence clearly shows that many companies\n10Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, who is said to have carried his coins around in\nan asbestos purse so that money wouldn’t burn a hole in his pocket, could\nhave avoided this problem if he had been a CEO.\n11A study by BusinessWeekfound that from 1995 through 2001, 61% out\nof more than 300 large mergers ended up destroying wealth for the share-\nholders of the acquiring company—a condition known as “the winner’s\ncurse” or “buyer’s remorse.” And acquirers using stock rather than cash to\npay for the deal underperformed rival companies by 8%. (David Henry,\n“Mergers: Why Most Big Deals Don’t Pay Off,” BusinessWeek,October 14,\n2002, pp. 60–70.) A similar academic study found that acquisitions of pri-\nvate companies and subsidiaries of public companies lead to positive stock\nreturns, but that acquisitions of entire public companies generate losses for\nthe winning bidder’s shareholders. (Kathleen Fuller, Jeffry Netter, and Mike\nStegemoller, “What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell Us?” The Journal of\nFinance,vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1763–1793.)\n12With interest rates near record lows, such a mountain of cash produces\nlousy returns if it just sits around. As Graham asserts, “So long as this sur-\nplus cash remains with the company, the outside stockholder gets little ben-\nefit from it” (1949 edition, p. 232). Indeed, by year-end 2002, Microsoft’s\ncash balance had swollen to $43.4 billion—clear proof that the company\ncould find no good use for the cash its businesses were generating. As\nGraham would say, Microsoft’s operationswere efficient, but its financeno\nlonger was. In a step toward redressing this problem, Microsoft declared in\nearly 2003 that it would begin paying a regular quarterly dividend.\nwww.fx1618.com506 Commentary on Chapter 19\ndon’t know how to turn excess cash into extra returns. What does the\nstatistical evidence tell us?\n• Research by money managers Robert Arnott and Clifford Asness\nfound that when current dividends are low, future corporate earn-\nings also turn out to be low. And when current dividends are high,\nso are future earnings. Over 10-year periods, the average rate of\nearnings growth was 3.9 points greater when dividends were\nhigh than when they were low.13\n• Columbia accounting professors Doron Nissim and Amir Ziv\nfound that companies that raise their dividend not only have better\nstock returns but that “dividend increases are associated with\n[higher] future profitability for at least four years after the dividend\nchange.”14\nIn short, most managers are wrong when they say that they can put\nyour cash to better use than you can. Paying out a dividend does not\nguarantee great results, but it does improve the return of the typical\nstock by yanking at least some cash out of the managers’ hands\nbefore they can either squander it or squirrel it away.\nSELLING LOW, BUYING HIGH\nWhat about the argument that companies can put spare cash to bet-\nter use by buying back their own shares?

That, in turn, should lift the stock price. Better yet, unlike a div-\nidend, a buyback is tax-free to investors who don’t sell their shares.15\nThus it increases the value of their stock without raising their tax bill.\nAnd if the shares are cheap, then spending spare cash to repurchase\nthem is an excellent use of the company’s capital.16\nAll this is true in theory. Unfortunately, in the real world, stock buy-\nbacks have come to serve a purpose that can only be described as\nsinister. Now that grants of stock options have become such a large\npart of executive compensation, many companies—especially in high-\ntech industries—must issue hundreds of millions of shares to give to\nthe managers who exercise those stock options.17But that would jack\n15The tax reforms proposed by President George W. Bush in early 2003\nwould change the taxability of dividends, but the fate of this legislation was\nnot yet clear by press time.\n16Historically, companies took a common-sense approach toward share\nrepurchases, reducing them when stock prices were high and stepping\nthem up when prices were low. After the stock market crash of October 19,\n1987, for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next\n12 days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in\nthe earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher. See\nMurali Jagannathan, Clifford P. Stephens, and Michael S. Weisbach, “Finan-\ncial Flexibility and the Choice Between Dividends and Stock Repurchases,”\nJournal of Financial Economics,vol. 57, no. 3, September, 2000, p. 362.\n17The stock options granted by a company to its executives and employees\ngive them the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in the future at a\ndiscounted price. That conversion of options to shares is called “exercising”\nthe options. The employees can then sell the shares at the current market\nprice and pocket the difference as profit. Because hundreds of millions of\noptions may be exercised in a given year, the company must increase its\nsupply of shares outstanding. Then, however, the company’s total net\nincome would be spread across a much greater number of shares, reducing\nits earnings per share. Therefore, the company typically feels compelled to\nbuy back other shares to cancel out the stock issued to the option holders.\nIn 1998, 63.5% of chief financial officers admitted that counteracting the\ndilution from options was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFO\nForum, “The Buyback Track,” Institutional Investor,July, 1998).\nwww.fx1618.com508 Commentary on Chapter 19\nup the number of shares outstanding and shrink earnings per share.\nTocounteract that dilution, the companies must turn right back around\nand repurchase millions of shares in the open market. By 2000, com-\npanies were spending an astounding 41.8% of their total net income\nto repurchase their own shares—up from 4.8% in 1980.18\nLet’s look at Oracle Corp., the software giant. Between June 1,\n1999, and May 31, 2000, Oracle issued 101 million shares of com-\nmon stock to its senior executives and another 26 million to employ-\nees at a cost of $484 million. Meanwhile, to keep the exercise of\nearlier stock options from diluting its earnings per share, Oracle spent\n$5.3 billion—or 52% of its total revenues that year—to buy back 290.7\nmillion shares of stock. Oracle issued the stock to insiders at an aver-\nage price of $3.53 per share and repurchased it at an average price of\n$18.26. Sell low, buy high: Is this any way to “enhance” shareholder\nvalue?19\nBy 2002, Oracle’s stock had fallen to less than half its peak in\n2000. Now that its shares were cheaper, did Oracle hasten to buy\nback more stock? Between June 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002, Oracle\ncut its repurchases to $2.8 billion, apparently because its executives\nand employees exercised fewer options that year. The same sell-low,\nbuy-high pattern is evident at dozens of other technology companies.\nWhat’s going on here? Two surprising factors are at work:\n18One of the main factors driving this change was the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission’s decision, in 1982, to relax its previous restrictions\non share repurchases. See Gustavo Grullon and Roni Michaely, “Dividends,\nShare Repurchases, and the Substitution Hypothesis,” The Journal of\nFinance,vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002, pp. 1649–1684.\n19Throughout his writings, Graham insists that corporate managements\nhave a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued, but also to\nmake sure it never gets overvalued. As he put it in Security Analysis(1934\ned., p. 515), “the responsibility of managements to act in the interest of their\nshareholders includes the obligation to prevent—in so far as they are able—\nthe establishment of either absurdly high or unduly low prices for their secu-\nrities.” Thus, enhancing shareholder value doesn’t just mean making sure\nthat the stock price does not go too low; it also means ensuring that the\nstock price does not go up to unjustifiable levels. If only the executives of\nInternet companies had heeded Graham’s wisdom back in 1999!\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 19 509\n• Companies get a tax break when executives and employees exer-\ncise stock options (which the IRS considers a “compensation\nexpense” to the company).20In its fiscal years from 2000 through\n2002, for example, Oracle reaped $1.69 billion in tax benefits as\ninsiders cashed in on options. Sprint Corp. pocketed $678 million\nin tax benefits as its executives and employees locked in $1.9 bil-\nlion in options profits in 1999 and 2000.\n• Asenior executive heavily compensated with stock options has a\nvested interest in favoring stock buybacks over dividends. Why?\nFor technical reasons, options increase in value as the price fluc-\ntuations of a stock grow more extreme. But dividends dampen the\nvolatility of a stock’s price. So, if the managers increased the divi-\ndend, they would lower the value of their own stock options.21\nNo wonder CEOs would much rather buy back stock than pay divi-\ndends—regardless of how overvalued the shares may be or how dras-\ntically that may waste the resources of the outside shareholders.\n20Incredibly, although options are considered a compensation expense on a\ncompany’s tax returns, they are not counted as an expense on the income\nstatement in financial reports to shareholders. Investors can only hope that\naccounting reforms will change this ludicrous practice.\n21See George W. Fenn and Nellie Liang, “Corporate Payout Policy and\nManagerial Stock Incentives,” Journal of Financial Economics,vol. 60, no. 1,\nApril, 2001, pp. 45–72. Dividends make stocks less volatile by providing a\nstream of current income that cushions shareholders against fluctuations in\nmarket value. Several researchers have found that the average profitability of\ncompanies with stock-buyback programs (but no cash dividends) is at least\ntwice as volatile as that of companies that pay dividends. Those more vari-\nable earnings will, in general, lead to bouncier share prices, making the man-\nagers’ stock options more valuable—by creating more opportunities when\nshare prices will be temporarily high. Today, about two-thirds of executive\ncompensation comes in the form of options and other noncash awards;\nthirty years ago, at least two-thirds of compensation came as cash.\nwww.fx1618.com510 Commentary on Chapter 19\nKEEPING THEIR OPTIONS OPEN\nFinally, drowsy investors have given their companies free rein to over-\npay executives in ways that are simply unconscionable. In 1997, Steve\nJobs, the cofounder of Apple Computer Inc., returned to the company\nas its “interim” chief executive officer. Already a wealthy man, Jobs\ninsisted on taking a cash salary of $1 per year. At year-end 1999, to\nthank Jobs for serving as CEO “for the previous 21/2 years without\ncompensation,” the board presented him with his very own Gulfstream\njet, at a cost to the company of a mere $90 million. The next month\nJobs agreed to drop “interim” from his job title, and the board\nrewarded him with options on 20 million shares. (Until then, Jobs had\nheld a grand total of two shares of Apple stock.)\nThe principle behind such option grants is to align the interests of\nmanagers with outside investors. If you are an outside Apple share-\nholder, you want its managers to be rewarded only if Apple’s stock\nearns superior returns. Nothing else could possibly be fair to you and\nthe other owners of the company.

This is the thread that runs through all the preceding dis-\ncussion of investment policy—often explicitly, sometimes in a less\ndirect fashion. Let us try now, briefly, to trace that idea in a con-\nnected argument.\nAll experienced investors recognize that the margin-of-safety\nconcept is essential to the choice of sound bonds and preferred\nstocks. For example, a railroad should have earned its total fixed\ncharges better than five times (before income tax), taking a period\nof years, for its bonds to qualify as investment-grade issues. This\npastability to earn in excess of interest requirements constitutes the\nmargin of safety that is counted on to protect the investor against\nloss or discomfiture in the event of some future decline in net\nincome. (The margin above charges may be stated in other ways—\n*“It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a\nsentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all\ntimes and situations. They presented him the words: ‘And this, too, shall\npass away.’ How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!—\nhow consoling in the depths of affliction! ‘And this, too, shall pass away.’ And\nyet let us hope it is not quite true.”—Abraham Lincoln, Address to the Wis-\nconsin State Agricultural Society, Milwaukee, September 30, 1859, in Abra-\nham Lincoln: Speeches and Writings, 1859–1865 (Library of America,\n1985), vowl. wII, pw. 1.f0x11. 618.com\n512“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 513\nfor example, in the percentage by which revenues or profits may\ndecline before the balance after interest disappears—but the under-\nlying idea remains the same.)\nThe bond investor does not expect future average earnings to\nwork out the same as in the past; if he were sure of that, the margin\ndemanded might be small. Nor does he rely to any controlling\nextent on his judgment as to whether future earnings will be mate-\nrially better or poorer than in the past, if he did that, he would have\nto measure his margin in terms of a carefully projected income\naccount, instead of emphasizing the margin shown in the past\nrecord. Here the function of the margin of safety is, in essence, that\nof rendering unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future. If the\nmargin is a large one, then it is enough to assume that future earn-\nings will not fall far below those of the past in order for an investor\nto feel sufficiently protected against the vicissitudes of time.\nThe margin of safety for bonds may be calculated, alternatively,\nby comparing the total value of the enterprise with the amount of\ndebt. (A similar calculation may be made for a preferred-stock\nissue.) If the business owes $10 million and is fairly worth $30 mil-\nlion, there is room for a shrinkage of two-thirds in value—at least\ntheoretically—before the bondholders will suffer loss. The amount\nof this extra value, or “cushion,” above the debt may be approxi-\nmated by using the average market price of the junior stock issues\nover a period of years. Since average stock prices are generally\nrelated to average earning power, the margin of “enterprise value”\nover debt and the margin of earnings over charges will in most\ncases yield similar results.\nSo much for the margin-of-safety concept as applied to “fixed-\nvalue investments.” Can it be carried over into the field of common\nstocks? Yes, but with some necessary modifications.\nThere are instances where a common stock may be considered\nsound because it enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good\nbond. This will occur, for example, when a company has outstand-\ning only common stock that under depression conditions is selling\nfor less than the amount of bonds that could safely be issued\nagainst its property and earning power.* That was the position of a\n*“Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential profits or, as\nhe puwtsw it, wthe. faxm1o6un1t t8ha.tc ao fimrm “might be expected to earn year after year514 The Intelligent Investor\nhost of strongly financed industrial companies at the low price lev-\nels of 1932–33. In such instances the investor can obtain the margin\nof safety associated with a bond, plus all the chances of larger\nincome and principal appreciation inherent in a common stock.\n(The only thing he lacks is the legal power to insist on dividend\npayments “or else”—but this is a small drawback as compared\nwith his advantages.) Common stocks bought under such circum-\nstances will supply an ideal, though infrequent, combination of\nsafety and profit opportunity. As a quite recent example of this con-\ndition, let us mention once more National Presto Industries stock,\nwhich sold for a total enterprise value of $43 million in 1972. With\nits $16 millions of recent earnings before taxes the company could\neasily have supported this amount of bonds.\nIn the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under\nnormal conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning\npower considerably above the going rate for bonds. In former edi-\ntions we elucidated this point with the following figures:\nAssume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the\nprice and that the bond rate is 4%; then the stockbuyer will have\nan average annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. Some of the\nexcess is paid to him in the dividend rate; even though spent by\nhim, it enters into his overall investment result. The undistributed\nbalance is reinvested in the business for his account. In many cases\nsuch reinvested earnings fail to add commensurately to the earn-\ning power and value of his stock. (That is why the market has a\nstubborn habit of valuing earnings disbursed in dividends more\ngenerously than the portion retained in the business.)* But, if the\npicture is viewed as a whole, there is a reasonably close connection\nif the business conditions prevailing during the period were to continue\nunchanged” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 354). Some of his lectures\nmake it clear that Graham intended the term to cover periods of five years or\nmore. You can crudely but conveniently approximate a company’s earning\npower per share by taking the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with\na P/E ratio of 11 can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by\n11). Today “earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”\n*This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on Chapter 19.\nwww.fx1618.com“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 515\nbetween the growth of corporate surpluses through reinvested\nearnings and the growth of corporate values.\nOver a ten-year period the typical excess of stock earning\npower over bond interest may aggregate 50% of the price paid.\nThis figure is sufficient to provide a very real margin of safety—\nwhich, under favorable conditions, will prevent or minimize a\nloss. If such a margin is present in each of a diversified list of\ntwenty or more stocks, the probability of a favorable result under\n“fairly normal conditions” becomes very large. That is why the\npolicy of investing in representative common stocks does not\nrequire high qualities of insight and foresight to work out success-\nfully. If the purchases are made at the average level of the market\nover a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assur-\nance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies\nin concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,\nor in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more\nthan average risk of diminished earning power.\nAs we see it, the whole problem of common-stock investment\nunder 1972 conditions lies in the fact that “in a typical case” the\nearning power is now much less than 9% on the price paid.* Let us\nassume that by concentrating somewhat on the low-multiplier\nissues among the large companies a defensive investor may now\n*Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a lecture he\ngave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between the percent-\nage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate\nof interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is the difference which would\nabsorb unsatisfactory developments. At the time the 1965 edition of The\nIntelligent Investor was written the typical stock was selling at 11 times\nearnings, giving about 9% return as against 4% on bonds. In that case you\nhad a margin of safety of over 100 per cent. Now [in 1972] there is no dif-\nference between the earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks,\nand I say there is no margin of safety...you have a negative margin of\nsafety on stocks...” See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analy-\nsis” [transcript of lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University busi-\nness school, March, 1972], Financial History,no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.\nwww.fx1618.com516 The Intelligent Investor\nacquire equities at 12 times recent earnings—i.e., with an earnings\nreturn of 8.33% on cost. He may obtain a dividend yield of about\n4%, and he will have 4.33% of his cost reinvested in the business for\nhis account. On this basis, the excess of stock earning power over\nbond interest over a ten-year basis would still be too small to con-\nstitute an adequate margin of safety. For that reason we feel that\nthere are real risks now even in a diversified list of sound common\nstocks. The risks may be fully offset by the profit possibilities of\nthe list; and indeed the investor may have no choice but to incur\nthem—for otherwise he may run an even greater risk of holding\nonly fixed claims payable in steadily depreciating dollars. None-\ntheless the investor would do well to recognize, and to accept\nas philosophically as he can, that the old package of good profit\npossibilities combined with small ultimate risk is no longer available\nto him.*\nHowever, the risk of paying too high a price for good-quality\nstocks—while a real one—is not the chief hazard confronting the\naverage buyer of securities. Observation over many years has\ntaught us that the chief losses to investors come from the purchase\nof low-quality securities at times of favorable business conditions.\nThe purchasers view the current good earnings as equivalent to\n“earning power” and assume that prosperity is synonymous with\nsafety. It is in those years that bonds and preferred stocks of infe-\nrior grade can be sold to the public at a price around par, because\nthey carry a little higher income return or a deceptively attractive\nconversion privilege. It is then, also, that common stocks of\nobscure companies can be floated at prices far above the tangible\ninvestment, on the strength of two or three years of excellent\ngrowth.\nThese securities do not offer an adequate margin of safety in any\nadmissible sense of the term. Coverage of interest charges and pre-\nferred dividends must be tested over a number of years, including\npreferably a period of subnormal business such as in 1970–71. The\nsame is ordinarily true of common-stock earnings if they are to\n*This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily pre-\ncise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more detail, see the\ncommentary on Chapter 3.)\nwww.fx1618.com“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 517\nqualify as indicators of earning power. Thus it follows that most of\nthe fair-weather investments, acquired at fair-weather prices, are\ndestined to suffer disturbing price declines when the horizon\nclouds over—and often sooner than that. Nor can the investor\ncount with confidence on an eventual recovery—although this\ndoes come about in some proportion of the cases—for he has never\nhad a real safety margin to tide him through adversity.\nThe philosophy of investment in growth stocks parallels in part\nand in part contravenes the margin-of-safety principle. The\ngrowth-stock buyer relies on an expected earning power that is\ngreater than the average shown in the past. Thus he may be said to\nsubstitute these expected earnings for the past record in calculating\nhis margin of safety. In investment theory there is no reason why\ncarefully estimated future earnings should be a less reliable guide\nthan the bare record of the past; in fact, security analysis is coming\nmore and more to prefer a competently executed evaluation of the\nfuture. Thus the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable\na margin of safety as is found in the ordinary investment—\nprovided the calculation of the future is conservatively made, and\nprovided it shows a satisfactory margin in relation to the price\npaid.\nThe danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For\nsuch favored issues the market has a tendency to set prices that\nwill not be adequately protected by a conservative projection of\nfuture earnings. (It is a basic rule of prudent investment that all\nestimates, when they differ from past performance, must err at\nleast slightly on the side of understatement.) The margin of safety\nis always dependent on the price paid. It will be large at one price,\nsmall at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price. If,\nas we suggest, the average market level of most growth stocks is\ntoo high to provide an adequate margin of safety for the buyer,\nthen a simple technique of diversified buying in this field may not\nwork out satisfactorily. Aspecial degree of foresight and judgment\nwill be needed, in order that wise individual selections may over-\ncome the hazards inherent in the customary market level of such\nissues as a whole.\nThe margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when\nwe apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We\nhave here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on\nwww.fx1618.com518 The Intelligent Investor\nthe one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. That\ndifference is the safety margin. It is available for absorbing the\neffect of miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of\nbargain issues places particular emphasis on the ability of the\ninvestment to withstand adverse developments. For in most such\ncases he has no real enthusiasm about the company’s prospects.\nTrue, if the prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to\navoid the security no matter how low the price. But the field of\nundervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns—perhaps a\nmajority of the total—for which the future appears neither dis-\ntinctly promising nor distinctly unpromising. If these are bought\non a bargain basis, even a moderate decline in the earning power\nneed not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory results.\nThe margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose.\nTheory of Diversification\nThere is a close logical connection between the concept of a\nsafety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correla-\ntive with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an\nindividual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees\nonly that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that\nloss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is\nincreased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the\nprofits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple\nbasis of the insurance-underwriting business.\nDiversification is an established tenet of conservative invest-\nment. By accepting it so universally, investors are really demon-\nstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which\ndiversification is the companion. This point may be made more col-\norful by a reference to the arithmetic of roulette. If a man bets $1 on\na single number, he is paid $35 profit when he wins—but the\nchances are 37 to 1 that he will lose. He has a “negative margin of\nsafety.” In his case diversification is foolish. The more numbers he\nbets on, the smaller his chance of ending with a profit. If he regu-\nlarly bets $1 on every number (including 0 and 00), he is certain to\nlose $2 on each turn of the wheel. But suppose the winner received\n$39 profit instead of $35. Then he would have a small but impor-\ntant margin of safety. Therefore, the more numbers he wagers on,\nwww.fx1618.com“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 519\nthe better his chance of gain. And he could be certain of winning $2\non every spin by simply betting $1 each on all the numbers. (Inci-\ndentally, the two examples given actually describe the respective\npositions of the player and proprietor of a wheel with 0 and 00.)*\nACriterion of Investment versus Speculation\nSince there is no single definition of investment in general\nacceptance, authorities have the right to define it pretty much as\nthey please. Many of them deny that there is any useful or depend-\nable difference between the concepts of investment and of specula-\ntion. We think this skepticism is unnecessary and harmful. It is\ninjurious because it lends encouragement to the innate leaning of\nmany people toward the excitement and hazards of stock-market\nspeculation. We suggest that the margin-of-safety concept may be\nused to advantage as the touchstone to distinguish an investment\noperation from a speculative one.\nProbably most speculators believe they have the odds in their\nfavor when they take their chances, and therefore they may lay\nclaim to a safety margin in their proceedings. Each one has the feel-\ning that the time is propitious for his purchase, or that his skill is\nsuperior to the crowd’s, or that his adviser or system is trustwor-\nthy. But such claims are unconvincing. They rest on subjective\njudgment, unsupported by any body of favorable evidence or any\n*In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with numbers\n1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a maximum payout\nof 35 to 1. What if you bet $1 on every number? Since only one slot can\nbe the one into which the ball drops, you would win $35 on that slot, but\nlose $1 on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of $2. That $2 differ-\nence (or a 5.26% spread on your total $38 bet) is the casino’s “house\nadvantage,” ensuring that, on average,roulette players will always lose more\nthan they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s interest to bet as seldom as\npossible, it is in the casino’s interest to keep the roulette wheel spinning.\nLikewise, the intelligent investor should seek to maximize the number of\nholdings that offer “a better chance for profit than for loss.” For most\ninvestors, diversification is the simplest and cheapest way to widen your\nmargin of safety.\nwww.fx1618.com520 The Intelligent Investor\nconclusive line of reasoning. We greatly doubt whether the man\nwho stakes money on his view that the market is heading up or\ndown can ever be said to be protected by a margin of safety in any\nuseful sense of the phrase.\nBy contrast, the investor’s concept of the margin of safety—as\ndeveloped earlier in this chapter—rests upon simple and definite\narithmetical reasoning from statistical data. We believe, also, that it\nis well supported by practical investment experience. There is no\nguarantee that this fundamental quantitative approach will con-\ntinue to show favorable results under the unknown conditions of\nthe future. But, equally, there is no valid reason for pessimism on\nthis score.\nThus, in sum, we say that to have a true investment there must\nbe present a true margin of safety. And a true margin of safety is\none that can be demonstrated by figures, by persuasive reasoning,\nand by reference to a body of actual experience.\nExtension of the Concept of Investment\nTocomplete our discussion of the margin-of-safety principle we\nmust now make a further distinction between conventional and\nunconventional investments. Conventional investments are appro-\npriate for the typical portfolio. Under this heading have always\ncome United States government issues and high-grade, dividend-\npaying common stocks. We have added state and municipal bonds\nfor those who will benefit sufficiently by their tax-exempt features.\nAlso included are first-quality corporate bonds when, as now, they\ncan be bought to yield sufficiently more than United States savings\nbonds.\nUnconventional investments are those that are suitable only for\nthe enterprising investor. They cover a wide range. The broadest\ncategory is that of undervalued common stocks of secondary com-\npanies, which we recommend for purchase when they can be\nbought at two-thirds or less of their indicated value. Besides these,\nthere is often a wide choice of medium-grade corporate bonds and\npreferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as\nto be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent\nvalue. In these cases the average investor would be inclined to call\nthe securities speculative, because in his mind their lack of a first-\nquality wratwinwg i.sf xsy1n6on1y8m.ocuos mwith a lack of investment merit.“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 521\nIt is our argument that a sufficiently low price can turn a secu-\nrity of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity—\nprovided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he\npractices adequate diversification. For, if the price is low enough to\ncreate a substantial margin of safety, the security thereby meets our\ncriterion of investment. Our favorite supporting illustration is\ntaken from the field of real-estate bonds. In the 1920s, billions of\ndollars’ worth of these issues were sold at par and widely recom-\nmended as sound investments. A large proportion had so little\nmargin of value over debt as to be in fact highly speculative in\ncharacter. In the depression of the 1930s an enormous quantity of\nthese bonds defaulted their interest, and their price collapsed—in\nsome cases below 10 cents on the dollar. At that stage the same\nadvisers who had recommended them at par as safe investments\nwere rejecting them as paper of the most speculative and unattrac-\ntive type. But as a matter of fact the price depreciation of about 90%\nmade many of these securities exceedingly attractive and reason-\nably safe—for the true values behind them were four or five times\nthe market quotation.*\nThe fact that the purchase of these bonds actually resulted in\nwhat is generally called “a large speculative profit” did not prevent\nthem from having true investment qualities at their low prices. The\n“speculative” profit was the purchaser’s reward for having made\nan unusually shrewd investment. They could properly be called\ninvestment opportunities, since a careful analysis would have\nshown that the excess of value over price provided a large margin\nof safety. Thus the very class of “fair-weather investments” which\nwe stated above is a chief source of serious loss to naïve security\nbuyers is likely to afford many sound profit opportunities to the\nsophisticated operator who may buy them later at pretty much his\nown price.†\n*Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad stock; there\nare only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best company\nbecomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the worst com-\npany is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.\n†The very people who considered technology and telecommunications\nstocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were hellishly\noverpwricwedw, s.hfuxn1ne6d 1th8em.c aos m“too risky” in 2002—even (cont’d on p. 522)522 The Intelligent Investor\nThe whole field of “special situations” would come under our\ndefinition of investment operations, because the purchase is\nalways predicated on a thoroughgoing analysis that promises a\nlarger realization than the price paid. Again there are risk factors in\neach individual case, but these are allowed for in the calculations\nand absorbed in the overall results of a diversified operation.\nTo carry this discussion to a logical extreme, we might suggest\nthat a defensible investment operation could be set up by buying\nsuch intangible values as are represented by a group of “common-\nstock option warrants” selling at historically low prices. (This\nexample is intended as somewhat of a shocker.)* The entire value\nof these warrants rests on the possibility that the related stocks\nmay some day advance above the option price. At the moment\nthey have no exercisable value. Yet, since all investment rests on\nreasonable future expectations, it is proper to view these warrants\nin terms of the mathematical chances that some future bull market\nwill create a large increase in their indicated value and in their\nprice. Such a study might well yield the conclusion that there is\nmuch more to be gained in such an operation than to be lost and\nthat the chances of an ultimate profit are much better than those of\nan ultimate loss. If that is so, there is a safety margin present even\n(cont’d from p. 521) though, in Graham’s exact words from an earlier\nperiod, “the price depreciation of about 90% made many of these securities\nexceedingly attractive and reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts\nhave always tended to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and\nto label it a “sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Gra-\nham (and simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the\nbook, Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that a\nstock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis of\nwhat the underlying business is worth.\n*Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for “warrant,”\na security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder a right to pur-\nchase the company’s stock at a predetermined price. Warrants have been\nalmost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham quips that he intends\nthe example as a “shocker” because, even in his day, warrants were\nregarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters. (See the commentary\non Chapter 16.)\nwww.fx1618.com“Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept of Investment 523\nin this unprepossessing security form. A sufficiently enterprising\ninvestor could then include an option-warrant operation in his\nmiscellany of unconventional investments.1\nTo Sum Up\nInvestment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike. It is\namazing to see how many capable businessmen try to operate in\nWall Street with complete disregard of all the sound principles\nthrough which they have gained success in their own undertak-\nings. Yet every corporate security may best be viewed, in the first\ninstance, as an ownership interest in, or a claim against, a specific\nbusiness enterprise. And if a person sets out to make profits from\nsecurity purchases and sales, he is embarking on a business ven-\nture of his own, which must be run in accordance with accepted\nbusiness principles if it is to have a chance of success.\nThe first and most obvious of these principles is, “Know what\nyou are doing—know your business.” For the investor this means:\nDo not try to make “business profits” out of securities—that is,\nreturns in excess of normal interest and dividend income—unless\nyou know as much about security values as you would need to\nknow about the value of merchandise that you proposed to manu-\nfacture or deal in.\nA second business principle: “Do not let anyone else run your\nbusiness, unless (1) you can supervise his performance with ade-\nquate care and comprehension or (2) you have unusually strong rea-\nsons for placing implicit confidence in his integrity and ability.” For\nthe investor this rule should determine the conditions under which\nhe will permit someone else to decide what is done with his money.\nAthird business principle: “Do not enter upon an operation—\nthat is, manufacturing or trading in an item—unless a reliable cal-\nculation shows that it has a fair chance to yield a reasonable profit.\nIn particular, keep away from ventures in which you have little to\ngain and much to lose.” For the enterprising investor this means\nthat his operations for profit should be based not on optimism but\non arithmetic. For every investor it means that when he limits his\nreturn to a small figure—as formerly, at least, in a conventional\nbond or preferred stock—he must demand convincing evidence\nthat he is not risking a substantial part of his principal.\nwww.fx1618.com524 The Intelligent Investor\nA fourth business rule is more positive: “Have the courage of\nyour knowledge and experience. If you have formed a conclusion\nfrom the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it—\neven though others may hesitate or differ.” (You are neither right\nnor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right\nbecause your data and reasoning are right.) Similarly, in the world\nof securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate\nknowledge and a tested judgment are at hand.\nFortunately for the typical investor, it is by no means necessary\nfor his success that he bring these qualities to bear upon his pro-\ngram—providedhe limits his ambition to his capacity and confines\nhis activities within the safe and narrow path of standard, defen-\nsive investment. To achieve satisfactoryinvestment results is easier\nthan most people realize; to achieve superiorresults is harder than it\nlooks.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 20\nIf we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected\nin a universe of infinite possibilities, we may find ourselves at\nthe mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed,\ncategorized, or easily referenced.\n—Agent Fox Mulder, The X-Files\nFIRST, DON’T LOSE\nWhat is risk?\nYou’ll get different answers depending on whom, and when, you\nask. In 1999, risk didn’t mean losing money; it meant making less\nmoney than someone else. What many people feared was bumping\ninto somebody at a barbecue who was getting even richer even\nquicker by day trading dot-com stocks than they were. Then, quite\nsuddenly, by 2003 risk had come to mean that the stock market might\nkeep dropping until it wiped out whatever traces of wealth you still had\nleft.\nWhile its meaning may seem nearly as fickle and fluctuating as the\nfinancial markets themselves, risk has some profound and permanent\nattributes. The people who take the biggest gambles and make the\nbiggest gains in a bull market are almost always the ones who get hurt\nthe worst in the bear market that inevitably follows. (Being “right”\nmakes speculators even more eager to take extra risk, as their confi-\ndence catches fire.)

If you overestimate\nhow well you really understand an investment, or overstate your ability\nto ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it doesn’t matter what you\nown or how the market does. Ultimately, financial risk resides not in\nwhat kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of investor you\nare. If you want to know what risk really is, go to the nearest bathroom\nand step up to the mirror. That’s risk, gazing back at you from the\nglass.\nAs you look at yourself in the mirror, what should you watch for?\nThe Nobel-prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman explains two\nfactors that characterize good decisions:\n• “well-calibrated confidence”(do I understand this investment as\nwell as I think I do?)\n• “correctly-anticipated regret” (how will I react if my analysis\nturns out to be wrong?).\nTo find out whether your confidence is well-calibrated, look in the\nmirror and ask yourself: “What is the likelihood that my analysis is\nright?” Think carefully through these questions:\n• How much experience do I have? What is my track record with\nsimilar decisions in the past?\n• What is the typical track record of other people who have tried\nthis in the past?3\n• If I am buying, someone else is selling. How likely is it that I know\nsomething that this other person (or company) does not know?\n• If I am selling, someone else is buying. How likely is it that I know\nsomething that this other person (or company) does not know?\n3No one who diligently researched the answer to this question, and hon-\nestly accepted the results, would ever have day traded or bought IPOs.\nwww.fx1618.comCommentary on Chapter 20 529\n• Have I calculated how much this investment needs to go up for\nme to break even after my taxes and costs of trading?\nNext, look in the mirror to find out whether you are the kind of per-\nson who correctly anticipates your regret. Start by asking: “Do I fully\nunderstand the consequences if my analysis turns out to be wrong?”\nAnswer that question by considering these points:\n• If I’m right, I could make a lot of money. But what if I’m wrong?\nBased on the historical performance of similar investments, how\nmuch could I lose?\n• Do I have other investments that will tide me over if this decision\nturns out to be wrong? Do I already hold stocks, bonds, or funds\nwith a proven record of going up when the kind of investment I’m\nconsidering goes down? Am I putting too much of my capital at\nrisk with this new investment?\n• When I tell myself, “You have a high tolerance for risk,” how do I\nknow? Have I ever lost a lot of money on an investment? How did\nit feel? Did I buy more, or did I bail out?\n• Am I relying on my willpower alone to prevent me from panicking\nat the wrong time? Or have I controlled my own behavior in\nadvance by diversifying, signing an investment contract, and dol-\nlar-cost averaging?\nYou should always remember, in the words of the psychologist Paul\nSlovic, that “risk is brewed from an equal dose of two ingredients—\nprobabilities and consequences.”4Before you invest, you must ensure\nthat you have realistically assessed your probability of being right and\nhow you will react to the consequences of being wrong.\nPASCAL’S WAGER\nThe investment philosopher Peter Bernstein has another way of sum-\nming this up. He reaches back to Blaise Pascal, the great French\nmathematician and theologian (1623–1662), who created a thought\n4Paul Slovic, “Informing and Educating the Public about Risk,” Risk Analy-\nsis,vol. 6, no. 4 (1986), p. 412.\nwww.fx1618.com530 Commentary on Chapter 20\nexperiment in which an agnostic must gamble on whether or not God\nexists. The ante this person must put up for the wager is his conduct\nin this life; the ultimate payoff in the gamble is the fate of his soul in the\nafterlife. In this wager, Pascal asserts, “reason cannot decide” the\nprobability of God’s existence. Either God exists or He does not—and\nonly faith, not reason, can answer that question. But while the proba-\nbilities in Pascal’s wager are a toss-up, the consequences are per-\nfectly clear and utterly certain. As Bernstein explains:\nSuppose you act as though God is and [you] lead a life of virtue and\nabstinence, when in fact there is no god. You will have passed up\nsome goodies in life, but there will be rewards as well. Now suppose\nyou act as though God is not and spend a life of sin, selfishness, and\nlust when in fact God is. You may have had fun and thrills during the\nrelatively brief duration of your lifetime, but when the day of judgment\nrolls around you are in big trouble.5\nConcludes Bernstein: “In making decisions under conditions of\nuncertainty, the consequences must dominate the probabilities. We\nnever know the future.” Thus, as Graham has reminded you in every\nchapter of this book, the intelligent investor must focus not just on get-\nting the analysis right. You must also ensure against loss if your analy-\nsis turns out to be wrong—as even the best analyses will be at least\nsome of the time. The probability of making at least one mistake at\nsome point in your investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds\nare entirely out of your control. However, you dohave control over the\nconsequences of being wrong. Many “investors” put essentially all of\ntheir money into dot-com stocks in 1999; an online survey of 1,338\nAmericans by MoneyMagazine in 1999 found that nearly one-tenth of\nthem had at least 85% of their money in Internet stocks. By ignoring\nGraham’s call for a margin of safety, these people took the wrong side\nof Pascal’s wager. Certain that they knew the probabilities of being\n5“The Wager,” in Blaise Pascal, Pensées (Penguin Books, London and\nNew York, 1995), pp. 122–125; Peter L.

They\nestablished a rather unique approach to security operations, which\ncombined good profit possibilities with sound values. They\navoided anything that appeared overpriced and were rather too\nquick to dispose of issues that had advanced to levels they deemed\nno longer attractive. Their portfolio was always well diversified,\nwith more than a hundred different issues represented. In this way\nthey did quite well through many years of ups and downs in the\ngeneral market; they averaged about 20% per annum on the sev-\neral millions of capital they had accepted for management, and\ntheir clients were well pleased with the results.*\nIn the year in which the first edition of this book appeared an\nopportunity was offered to the partners’ fund to purchase a half-\ninterest in a growing enterprise. For some reason the industry did\nnot have Wall Street appeal at the time and the deal had been turned\ndown by quite a few important houses. But the pair was impressed\nby the company’s possibilities; what was decisive for them was that\nthe price was moderate in relation to current earnings and asset\nvalue. The partners went ahead with the acquisition, amounting in\ndollars to about one-fifth of their fund. They became closely identi-\nfied with the new business interest, which prospered.†\n*The two partners Graham coyly refers to are Jerome Newman and Ben-\njamin Graham himself.\n†Graham is describing the Government Employees Insurance Co., or\nGEICO, win wwhwich. fhxe1 an6d1 N8ew.cmoanm purchased a 50% interest in 1948, right\n532Postscript 533\nIn fact it did so well that the price of its shares advanced to two\nhundred times or more the price paid for the half-interest. The\nadvance far outstripped the actual growth in profits, and almost\nfrom the start the quotation appeared much too high in terms of\nthe partners’ own investment standards. But since they regarded\nthe company as a sort of “family business,” they continued to\nmaintain a substantial ownership of the shares despite the spectac-\nular price rise. Alarge number of participants in their funds did the\nsame, and they became millionaires through their holding in this\none enterprise, plus later-organized affiliates.*\nIronically enough, the aggregate of profits accruing from this\nsingle investment decision far exceeded the sum of all the others\nrealized through 20 years of wide-ranging operations in the part-\nners’ specialized fields, involving much investigation, endless pon-\ndering, and countless individual decisions.\nAre there morals to this story of value to the intelligent investor?\nAn obvious one is that there are several different ways to make\nand keep money in Wall Street. Another, not so obvious, is that\none lucky break, or one supremely shrewd decision—can we tell\nthem apart?—may count for more than a lifetime of journeyman\nefforts.1 But behind the luck, or the crucial decision, there must\nusually exist a background of preparation and disciplined capacity.\nOne needs to be sufficiently established and recognized so that\nthese opportunities will knock at his particular door. One must\naround the time he finished writing The Intelligent Investor. The $712,500\nthat Graham and Newman put into GEICO was roughly 25% of their fund’s\nassets at the time. Graham was a member of GEICO’s board of directors\nfor many years. In a nice twist of fate, Graham’s greatest student, Warren\nBuffett, made an immense bet of his own on GEICO in 1976, by which time\nthe big insurer had slid to the brink of bankruptcy. It turned out to be one of\nBuffett’s best investments as well.\n*Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed by the\nU.S. Securities & Exchange Commission to “spin off,” or distribute, Graham-\nNewman Corp.’s GEICO stake to the fund’s shareholders. An investor who\nowned 100 shares of Graham-Newman at the beginning of 1948 (worth\n$11,413) and who then held on to the GEICO distribution would have had\n$1.66 million by 1972.

We are not going to end with J. J. Raskob’s slogan that we\nmade fun of at the beginning: “Everybody can be rich.” But inter-\nesting possibilities abound on the financial scene, and the intelli-\ngent and enterprising investor should be able to find both\nenjoyment and profit in this three-ring circus. Excitement is guar-\nanteed.\nwww.fx1618.comCOMMENTARY ON POSTSCRIPT\nS\nuccessful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. At first\nglance, when you realize that Graham put 25% of his fund into a sin-\ngle stock, you might think he was gambling rashly with his investors’\nmoney. But then, when you discover that Graham had painstakingly\nestablished that he could liquidate GEICO for at least what he paid\nfor it, it becomes clear that Graham was taking very little financial risk.\nBut he needed enormous courage to take the psychological risk of\nsuch a big bet on so unknown a stock.1\nAnd today’s headlines are full of fearful facts and unresolved risks:\nthe death of the 1990s bull market, sluggish economic growth, corpo-\nrate fraud, the specters of terrorism and war. “Investors don’t like\nuncertainty,” a market strategist is intoning right now on financial TV or\nin today’s newspaper. But investors have never liked uncertainty—and\nyet it is the most fundamental and enduring condition of the investing\nworld. It always has been, and it always will be. At heart, “uncertainty”\nand “investing” are synonyms. In the real world, no one has ever been\ngiven the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buy\nstocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at\nall. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.\nThe most literate of investors, Graham loved the story of Ulysses,\ntold through the poetry of Homer, Alfred Tennyson, and Dante. Late in\nhis life, Graham relished the scene in Dante’s Inferno when Ulysses\ndescribes inspiring his crew to sail westward into the unknown waters\nbeyond the gates of Hercules:\n1Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who are\nnot as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against the risk of\nputting too much money into a single investment. When Graham himself\nadmits that GEICO was a “lucky break,” that’s a signal that most of us can-\nnot count on being able to find such a great opportunity.

The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\nby Warren E. Buffett\nEDITOR’S NOTE: This article is an edited transcript of a talk given at\nColumbia University in 1984 commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of\nSecurity Analysis, written by Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd.\nThis specialized volume first introduced the ideas later popularized in\nThe Intelligent Investor. Buffett’s essay offers a fascinating study of how\nGraham’s disciples have used Graham’s value investing approach to real-\nize phenomenal success in the stock market.\nIs the Graham and Dodd “look for values with a significant\nmargin of safety relative to prices” approach to security analysis\nout of date? Many of the professors who write textbooks today say\nyes. They argue that the stock market is efficient; that is, that stock\nprices reflect everything that is known about a company’s\nprospects and about the state of the economy. There are no under-\nvalued stocks, these theorists argue, because there are smart secu-\nrity analysts who utilize all available information to ensure\nunfailingly appropriate prices. Investors who seem to beat the mar-\nket year after year are just lucky. “If prices fully reflect available\ninformation, this sort of investment adeptness is ruled out,” writes\none of today’s textbook authors.\nWell, maybe. But I want to present to you a group of investors\nwho have, year in and year out, beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500\nstock index. The hypothesis that they do this by pure chance is at\nwww.fx1618.com\n537538 Appendixes\nleast worth examining. Crucial to this examination is the fact that\nthese winners were all well known to me and pre-identified as\nsuperior investors, the most recent identification occurring over fif-\nteen years ago. Absent this condition—that is, if I had just recently\nsearched among thousands of records to select a few names for you\nthis morning—I would advise you to stop reading right here. I\nshould add that all these records have been audited. And I should\nfurther add that I have known many of those who have invested\nwith these managers, and the checks received by those participants\nover the years have matched the stated records.\nBefore we begin this examination, I would like you to imagine a\nnational coin-flipping contest. Let’s assume we get 225 million\nAmericans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a\ndollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the\nflip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who\ncalled wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent\nday the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line.\nAfter ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately\n220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten\nflips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.\nNow this group will probably start getting a little puffed up\nabout this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be mod-\nest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive\nmembers of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what\nmarvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.\nAssuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards\nfrom the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who\nhave successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who,\nby this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over\n$1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would\nhave been won.\nBy then, this group will really lose their heads. They will proba-\nbly write books on “How I Turned a Dollar into a Million in\nTwenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.” Worse yet,\nthey’ll probably start jetting around the country attending semi-\nnars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors\nwith, “If it can’t be done, why are there 215 of us?”\nBut then some business school professor will probably be\nrude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 539\nhad engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much\nthe same—215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning\nflips.\nI would argue, however, that there are some important differ-\nences in the examples I am going to present. For one thing, if (a)\nyou had taken 225 million orangutans distributed roughly as the\nU.S. population is; if (b) 215 winners were left after 20 days; and if\n(c) you found that 40 came from a particular zoo in Omaha, you\nwould be pretty sure you were on to something. So you would\nprobably go out and ask the zookeeper about what he’s feeding\nthem, whether they had special exercises, what books they read,\nand who knows what else. That is, if you found any really extraor-\ndinary concentrations of success, you might want to see if you\ncould identify concentrations of unusual characteristics that might\nbe causal factors.\nScientific inquiry naturally follows such a pattern. If you were\ntrying to analyze possible causes of a rare type of cancer—with,\nsay, 1,500 cases a year in the United States—and you found that 400\nof them occurred in some little mining town in Montana, you\nwould get very interested in the water there, or the occupation of\nthose afflicted, or other variables. You know that it’s not random\nchance that 400 come from a small area. You would not necessarily\nknow the causal factors, but you would know where to search.\nI submit to you that there are ways of defining an origin other\nthan geography. In addition to geographical origins, there can be\nwhat I call an intellectualorigin. I think you will find that a dispro-\nportionate number of successful coin-flippers in the investment\nworld came from a very small intellectual village that could be\ncalled Graham-and-Doddsville. A concentration of winners that\nsimply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particu-\nlar intellectual village.\nConditions could exist that would make even that concentration\nunimportant. Perhaps 100 people were simply imitating the coin-\nflipping call of some terribly persuasive personality. When he\ncalled heads, 100 followers automatically called that coin the same\nway. If the leader was part of the 215 left at the end, the fact that\n100 came from the same intellectual origin would mean nothing.\nYou would simply be identifying one case as a hundred cases. Sim-\nilarly, let’s assume that you lived in a strongly patriarchal society\nwww.fx1618.com540 Appendixes\nand every family in the United States conveniently consisted of ten\nmembers. Further assume that the patriarchal culture was so\nstrong that, when the 225 million people went out the first day,\nevery member of the family identified with the father’s call. Now,\nat the end of the 20-day period, you would have 215 winners, and\nyou would find that they came from only 21.5 families. Some naive\ntypes might say that this indicates an enormous hereditary factor\nas an explanation of successful coin-flipping. But, of course, it\nwould have no significance at all because it would simply mean\nthat you didn’t have 215 individual winners, but rather 21.5 ran-\ndomly distributed families who were winners.\nIn this group of successful investors that I want to consider,\nthere has been a common intellectual patriarch, Ben Graham. But\nthe children who left the house of this intellectual patriarch have\ncalled their “flips” in very different ways. They have gone to differ-\nent places and bought and sold different stocks and companies, yet\nthey have had a combined record that simply can’t be explained by\nrandom chance. It certainly cannot be explained by the fact that\nthey are all calling flips identically because a leader is signaling the\ncalls to make. The patriarch has merely set forth the intellectual\ntheory for making coin-calling decisions, but each student has\ndecided on his own manner of applying the theory.\nThe common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-\nand-Doddsville is this: they search for discrepancies between the\nvalueof a business and the priceof small pieces of that business in\nthe market. Essentially, they exploit those discrepancies without\nthe efficient market theorist’s concern as to whether the stocks are\nbought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July,\netc. Incidentally, when businessmen buy businesses—which is just\nwhat our Graham & Dodd investors are doing through the\nmedium of marketable stocks—I doubt that many are cranking\ninto their purchase decision the day of the week or the month in\nwhich the transaction is going to occur. If it doesn’t make any dif-\nference whether all of a business is being bought on a Monday or a\nFriday, I am baffled why academicians invest extensive time and\neffort to see whether it makes a difference when buying small\npieces of those same businesses. Our Graham & Dodd investors,\nneedless to say, do not discuss beta, the capital asset pricing model,\nor covariance in returns among securities. These are not subjects of\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 541\nany interest to them. In fact, most of them would have difficulty\ndefining those terms. The investors simply focus on two variables:\nprice and value.\nI always find it extraordinary that so many studies are made of\nprice and volume behavior, the stuff of chartists. Can you imagine\nbuying an entire business simply because the price of the business\nhad been marked up substantially last week and the week before?\nOf course, the reason a lot of studies are made of these price and\nvolume variables is that now, in the age of computers, there are\nalmost endless data available about them. It isn’t necessarily\nbecause such studies have any utility; it’s simply that the data are\nthere and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathemati-\ncal skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are\nacquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no\nutility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer,\neverything looks like a nail.\nI think the group that we have identified by a common intellec-\ntual home is worthy of study. Incidentally, despite all the academic\nstudies of the influence of such variables as price, volume, season-\nality, capitalization size, etc., upon stock performance, no interest\nhas been evidenced in studying the methods of this unusual con-\ncentration of value-oriented winners.\nI begin this study of results by going back to a group of four of\nus who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954\nthrough 1956. There were only four—I have not selected these\nnames from among thousands. I offered to go to work at Graham-\nNewman for nothing after I took Ben Graham’s class, but he turned\nme down as overvalued. He took this value stuff very seriously!\nAfter much pestering he finally hired me. There were three part-\nners and four of us at the “peasant” level. All four left between\n1955 and 1957 when the firm was wound up, and it’s possible to\ntrace the record of three.\nThe first example (see Table 1, pages 549–550) is that of Walter\nSchloss. Walter never went to college, but took a course from Ben\nGraham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left\nGraham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here\nover 28 years.\nHere is what “Adam Smith”—after I told him about Walter—\nwrote about him in Supermoney(1972):\nwww.fx1618.com542 Appendixes\nHe has no connections or access to useful information. Practi-\ncally no one in Wall Street knows him and he is not fed any ideas.\nHe looks up the numbers in the manuals and sends for the annual\nreports, and that’s about it.\nIn introducing me to [Schloss] Warren had also, to my mind,\ndescribed himself. “He never forgets that he is handling other\npeople’s money and this reinforces his normal strong aversion to\nloss.” He has total integrity and a realistic picture of himself.\nMoney is real to him and stocks are real—and from this flows an\nattraction to the “margin of safety” principle.\nWalter has diversified enormously, owning well over 100 stocks\ncurrently. He knows how to identify securities that sell at consider-\nably less than their value to a private owner. And that’s all he does.\nHe doesn’t worry about whether it’s January, he doesn’t worry\nabout whether it’s Monday, he doesn’t worry about whether it’s an\nelection year. He simply says, if a business is worth a dollar and I\ncan buy it for 40 cents, something good may happen to me. And he\ndoes it over and over and over again. He owns many more stocks\nthan I do—and is far less interested in the underlying nature of the\nbusiness: I don’t seem to have very much influence on Walter.\nThat’s one of his strengths; no one has much influence on him.\nThe second case is Tom Knapp, who also worked at Graham-\nNewman with me. Tom was a chemistry major at Princeton before\nthe war; when he came back from the war, he was a beach bum.\nAnd then one day he read that Dave Dodd was giving a night\ncourse in investments at Columbia. Tom took it on a noncredit\nbasis, and he got so interested in the subject from taking that\ncourse that he came up and enrolled at Columbia Business School,\nwhere he got the MBAdegree. He took Dodd’s course again, and\ntook Ben Graham’s course. Incidentally, 35 years later I called Tom\nto ascertain some of the facts involved here and I found him on the\nbeach again. The only difference is that now he owns the beach!\nIn 1968 Tom Knapp and Ed Anderson, also a Graham disciple,\nalong with one or two other fellows of similar persuasion, formed\nTweedy, Browne Partners, and their investment results appear in\nTable 2. Tweedy, Browne built that record with very wide diversifi-\ncation. They occasionally bought control of businesses, but the\nrecord of the passive investments is equal to the record of the con-\ntrol invewstwmewnt.sf.x1618.comAppendixes 543\nTable 3 describes the third member of the group who formed\nBuffett Partnership in 1957. The best thing he did was to quit in\n1969. Since then, in a sense, Berkshire Hathaway has been a contin-\nuation of the partnership in some respects. There is no single index\nI can give you that I would feel would be a fair test of investment\nmanagement at Berkshire. But I think that any way you figure it, it\nhas been satisfactory.\nTable 4 shows the record of the Sequoia Fund, which is managed\nby a man whom I met in 1951 in Ben Graham’s class, Bill Ruane.\nAfter getting out of Harvard Business School, he went to Wall\nStreet. Then he realized that he needed to get a real business educa-\ntion so he came up to take Ben’s course at Columbia, where we met\nin early 1951. Bill’s record from 1951 to 1970, working with rela-\ntively small sums, was far better than average. When I wound up\nBuffett Partnership I asked Bill if he would set up a fund to handle\nall our partners, so he set up the Sequoia Fund. He set it up at a ter-\nrible time, just when I was quitting. He went right into the two-tier\nmarket and all the difficulties that made for comparative perfor-\nmance for value-oriented investors. I am happy to say that my\npartners, to an amazing degree, not only stayed with him but\nadded money, with the happy result shown.\nThere’s no hindsight involved here. Bill was the only person I\nrecommended to my partners, and I said at the time that if he\nachieved a four-point-per-annum advantage over the Standard &\nPoor’s, that would be solid performance. Bill has achieved well\nover that, working with progressively larger sums of money. That\nmakes things much more difficult. Size is the anchor of perfor-\nmance. There is no question about it. It doesn’t mean you can’t do\nbetter than average when you get larger, but the margin shrinks.\nAnd if you ever get so you’re managing two trillion dollars, and\nthat happens to be the amount of the total equity evaluation in the\neconomy, don’t think that you’ll do better than average!\nI should add that in the records we’ve looked at so far, through-\nout this whole period there was practically no duplication in these\nportfolios. These are men who select securities based on discrepan-\ncies between price and value, but they make their selections very\ndifferently. Walter’s largest holdings have been such stalwarts as\nHudson Pulp & Paper and Jeddo Highland Coal and New York\nTrap Rock Company and all those other names that come instantly\nto mwinwd wto .fexve1n6 a1 8ca.scuoalm reader of the business pages. Tweedy544 Appendixes\nBrowne’s selections have sunk even well below that level in terms\nof name recognition. On the other hand, Bill has worked with big\ncompanies. The overlap among these portfolios has been very, very\nlow. These records do not reflect one guy calling the flip and fifty\npeople yelling out the same thing after him.\nTable 5 is the record of a friend of mine who is a Harvard Law\ngraduate, who set up a major law firm. I ran into him in about 1960\nand told him that law was fine as a hobby but he could do better.\nHe set up a partnership quite the opposite of Walter’s. His portfo-\nlio was concentrated in very few securities and therefore his record\nwas much more volatile but it was based on the same discount-\nfrom-value approach. He was willing to accept greater peaks and\nvalleys of performance, and he happens to be a fellow whose\nwhole psyche goes toward concentration, with the results shown.\nIncidentally, this record belongs to Charlie Munger, my partner\nfor a long time in the operation of Berkshire Hathaway. When he\nran his partnership, however, his portfolio holdings were almost\ncompletely different from mine and the other fellows mentioned\nearlier.\nTable 6 is the record of a fellow who was a pal of Charlie\nMunger’s—another non–business school type—who was a math\nmajor at USC. He went to work for IBM after graduation and was\nan IBM salesman for a while. After I got to Charlie, Charlie got to\nhim. This happens to be the record of Rick Guerin. Rick, from 1965\nto 1983, against a compounded gain of 316 percent for the S&P,\ncame off with 22,200 percent, which, probably because he lacks a\nbusiness school education, he regards as statistically significant.\nOne sidelight here: it is extraordinary to me that the idea of buy-\ning dollar bills for 40 cents takes immediately with people or it\ndoesn’t take at all. It’s like an inoculation. If it doesn’t grab a per-\nson right away, I find that you can talk to him for years and show\nhim records, and it doesn’t make any difference. They just don’t\nseem able to grasp the concept, simple as it is. Afellow like Rick\nGuerin, who had no formal education in business, understands\nimmediately the value approach to investing and he’s applying it\nfive minutes later. I’ve never seen anyone who became a gradual\nconvert over a ten-year period to this approach. It doesn’t seem to\nbe a matter of IQ or academic training. It’s instant recognition, or it\nis nothing.\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 545\nTable 7 is the record of Stan Perlmeter. Stan was a liberal arts\nmajor at the University of Michigan who was a partner in the\nadvertising agency of Bozell & Jacobs. We happened to be in the\nsame building in Omaha. In 1965 he figured out I had a better busi-\nness than he did, so he left advertising. Again, it took five minutes\nfor Stan to embrace the value approach.\nPerlmeter does not own what Walter Schloss owns. He does not\nown what Bill Ruane owns. These are records made independently.\nBut every time Perlmeter buys a stock it’s because he’s getting\nmore for his money than he’s paying. That’s the only thing he’s\nthinking about. He’s not looking at quarterly earnings projections,\nhe’s not looking at next year’s earnings, he’s not thinking about\nwhat day of the week it is, he doesn’t care what investment\nresearch from any place says, he’s not interested in price momen-\ntum, volume, or anything. He’s simply asking: What is the busi-\nness worth?\nTable 8 and Table 9 are the records of two pension funds I’ve been\ninvolved in. They are not selected from dozens of pension funds with\nwhich I have had involvement; they are the only two I have influ-\nenced. In both cases I have steered them toward value-oriented man-\nagers. Very, very few pension funds are managed from a value\nstandpoint. Table 8 is the Washington Post Company’s Pension\nFund. It was with a large bank some years ago, and I suggested that\nthey would do well to select managers who had a value orientation.\nAs you can see, overall they have been in the top percentile ever\nsince they made the change. The Post told the managers to keep at\nleast 25 percent of these funds in bonds, which would not have\nbeen necessarily the choice of these managers. So I’ve included the\nbond performance simply to illustrate that this group has no par-\nticular expertise about bonds. They wouldn’t have said they did.\nEven with this drag of 25 percent of their fund in an area that was\nnot their game, they were in the top percentile of fund manage-\nment. The Washington Post experience does not cover a terribly\nlong period but it does represent many investment decisions by\nthree managers who were not identified retroactively.\nTable 9 is the record of the FMC Corporation fund. I don’t man-\nage a dime of it myself but I did, in 1974, influence their decision to\nselect value-oriented managers. Prior to that time they had selected\nmanagers much the same way as most larger companies. They now\nwww.fx1618.com546 Appendixes\nrank number one in the Becker survey of pension funds for their\nsize over the period of time subsequent to this “conversion” to the\nvalue approach. Last year they had eight equity managers of any\nduration beyond a year. Seven of them had a cumulative record\nbetter than the S&P. All eight had a better record last year than the\nS&P. The net difference now between a median performance and\nthe actual performance of the FMC fund over this period is $243\nmillion. FMC attributes this to the mindset given to them about the\nselection of managers. Those managers are not the managers I\nwould necessarily select but they have the common denominator\nof selecting securities based on value.\nSo these are nine records of “coin-flippers” from Graham-and-\nDoddsville. I haven’t selected them with hindsight from among\nthousands. It’s not like I am reciting to you the names of a bunch of\nlottery winners—people I had never heard of before they won the\nlottery. I selected these men years ago based upon their framework\nfor investment decision-making. I knew what they had been taught\nand additionally I had some personal knowledge of their intellect,\ncharacter, and temperament. It’s very important to understand that\nthis group has assumed far less risk than average; note their record\nin years when the general market was weak. While they differ\ngreatly in style, these investors are, mentally, always buying the\nbusiness, not buying the stock.Afew of them sometimes buy whole\nbusinesses. Far more often they simply buy small pieces of busi-\nnesses. Their attitude, whether buying all or a tiny piece of a busi-\nness, is the same. Some of them hold portfolios with dozens of\nstocks; others concentrate on a handful. But all exploit the differ-\nence between the market price of a business and its intrinsic value.\nI’m convinced that there is much inefficiency in the market.\nThese Graham-and-Doddsville investors have successfully ex-\nploited gaps between price and value. When the price of a stock\ncan be influenced by a “herd” on Wall Street with prices set at the\nmargin by the most emotional person, or the greediest person, or\nthe most depressed person, it is hard to argue that the market\nalways prices rationally. In fact, market prices are frequently non-\nsensical.\nI would like to say one important thing about risk and reward.\nSometimes risk and reward are correlated in a positive fashion. If\nsomeone were to say to me, “I have here a six-shooter and I have\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 547\nslipped one cartridge into it. Why don’t you just spin it and pull it\nonce? If you survive, I will give you $1 million.” I would decline—\nperhaps stating that $1 million is not enough. Then he might offer\nme $5 million to pull the trigger twice—now that would be a posi-\ntive correlation between risk and reward!\nThe exact opposite is true with value investing. If you buy a dol-\nlar bill for 60 cents, it’s riskier than if you buy a dollar bill for\n40 cents, but the expectation of reward is greater in the latter case.\nThe greater the potential for reward in the value portfolio, the less\nrisk there is.\nOne quick example: The Washington Post Company in 1973 was\nselling for $80 million in the market. At the time, that day, you\ncould have sold the assets to any one of ten buyers for not less than\n$400 million, probably appreciably more. The company owned the\nPost, Newsweek, plus several television stations in major markets.\nThose same properties are worth $2 billion now, so the person who\nwould have paid $400 million would not have been crazy.\nNow, if the stock had declined even further to a price that made\nthe valuation $40 million instead of $80 million, its beta would\nhave been greater. And to people who think beta measures risk, the\ncheaper price would have made it look riskier. This is truly Alice in\nWonderland. I have never been able to figure out why it’s riskier to\nbuy $400 million worth of properties for $40 million than $80 mil-\nlion. And, as a matter of fact, if you buy a group of such securities\nand you know anything at all about business valuation, there is\nessentially no risk in buying $400 million for $80 million, particu-\nlarly if you do it by buying ten $40 million piles for $8 million each.\nSince you don’t have your hands on the $400 million, you want to\nbe sure you are in with honest and reasonably competent people,\nbut that’s not a difficult job.\nYou also have to have the knowledge to enable you to make a\nvery general estimate about the value of the underlying businesses.\nBut you do not cut it close. That is what Ben Graham meant by\nhaving a margin of safety. You don’t try and buy businesses worth\n$83 million for $80 million. You leave yourself an enormous mar-\ngin. When you build a bridge, you insist it can carry 30,000\npounds, but you only drive 10,000-pound trucks across it. And that\nsame principle works in investing.\nIn conclusion, some of the more commercially minded among\nwww.fx1618.com548 Appendixes\nyou may wonder why I am writing this article. Adding many con-\nverts to the value approach will perforce narrow the spreads\nbetween price and value. I can only tell you that the secret has been\nout for 50 years, ever since Ben Graham and Dave Dodd wrote\nSecurity Analysis, yet I have seen no trend toward value investing\nin the 35 years that I’ve practiced it. There seems to be some per-\nverse human characteristic that likes to make easy things difficult.\nThe academic world, if anything, has actually backed away from\nthe teaching of value investing over the last 30 years. It’s likely to\ncontinue that way. Ships will sail around the world but the Flat\nEarth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrep-\nancies between price and value in the marketplace, and those who\nread their Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.\nTables 1–9

Important Rules Concerning Taxability of Investment\nIncome and Security Transactions (in 1972)\nEditor’s note: Due to extensive changes in the rules governing such\ntransactions, the following document is presented here for historical\npurposes only. When first written by Benjamin Graham in 1972, all the\ninformation therein was correct. However, intervening developments\nhave rendered this document inaccurate for today’s purposes. Follow-\ning Graham’s original Appendix 2 is a revised and updated version of\n“The Basics of Investment Taxation,” which brings the reader up-to-\ndate on the relevant rules.\nRule 1—Interest and Dividends\nInterest and dividends are taxable as ordinary income except (a)\nincome received from state, municipal, and similar obligations,\nwhich are free from Federal tax but may be subject to state tax, (b)\ndividends representing a return of capital, (c) certain dividends\npaid by investment companies (see below), and (d) the first $100 of\nordinary domestic-corporation dividends.\nRule 2—Capital Gains and Losses\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net\nshort-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses\nare merged to obtain the net long-term capital gain or loss. If the\nnet short-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss,\n100 per cent of such excess shall be included in income. The maxi-\nmum tax thereon is 25% up to $50,000 of such gains and 35% on the\nbalance.\nA net capital loss (the amount exceeding capital gains) is\ndeductible from ordinary income to a maximum of $1,000 in the\ncurrent year and in each of the next five years. Alternatively,\nunused losses may be applied at any time to offset capital gains.\n(Carry-overs of losses taken before 1970 are treated more liberally\nthan later losses.)\nNote Concerning “Regulated Investment Companies”\nMost investment funds (“investment companies”) take advan-\ntage of special provisions of the tax law, which enable them to be\nwww.fx1618.com562 Appendixes\ntaxed substantially as partnerships. Thus if they make long-term\nsecurity profits they can distribute these as “capital-gain divi-\ndends,” which are reported by their shareholders in the same way\nas long-term gains. These carry a lower tax rate than ordinary divi-\ndends. Alternatively, such a company may elect to pay the 25% tax\nfor the account of its shareholders and then retain the balance of\nthe capital gains without distributing them as capital-gain divi-\ndends.\n3. The Basics of Investment Taxation (Updated as of 2003)\nInterest and Dividends\nInterest and dividends are taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate\nexcept (a) interest received from municipal bonds, which is free from\nFederal income tax but may be subject to state tax, (b) dividends rep-\nresenting a return of capital, and (c) long-term capital-gain distribu-\ntions paid by mutual funds (see below). Private-activity municipal\nbonds, even within a mutual fund, may subject you to the Federal alter-\nnative minimum tax.\nCapital Gains and Losses\nShort-term capital gains and losses are merged to obtain net short-\nterm capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains and losses are\nmerged to determine your net long-term capital gain or loss. If your net\nshort-term capital gain exceeds the net long-term capital loss, that\nexcess is counted as ordinary income. If there is a net long-term capi-\ntal gain, it is taxed at the favorable capital gains rate, generally 20%—\nwhich will fall to 18% for investments purchased after December 31,\n2000, and held for more than five years.\nA net capital loss is deductible from ordinary income to a maxim-\num of $3,000 in the current year. Any capital losses in excess of\n$3,000 may be applied in later tax years to offset future capital\ngains.\nMutual Funds\nAs “regulated investment companies,” nearly all mutual funds take\nadvantage of special provisions of the tax law that exempt them from\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 563\ncorporate income tax. After selling long-term holdings, mutual funds\ncan distribute the profits as “capital-gain dividends,” which their share-\nholders treat as long-term gains. These are taxed at a lower rate (gen-\nerally 20%) than ordinary dividends (up to 39%). You should generally\navoid making large new investments during the fourth quarter of each\nyear, when these capital-gain distributions are usually distributed; oth-\nerwise you will incur tax for a gain earned by the fund before you even\nowned it.\n4. The New Speculation in Common Stocks1\nWhat I shall have to say will reflect the spending of many years\nin Wall Street, with their attendant varieties of experience. This has\nincluded the recurrent advent of new conditions, or a new atmo-\nsphere, which challenge the value of experience itself. It is true that\none of the elements that distinguish economics, finance, and secu-\nrity analysis from other practical disciplines is the uncertain valid-\nity of past phenomena as a guide to the present and future. Yet we\nhave no right to reject the lessons of the past until we have at least\nstudied and understood them. My address today is an effort\ntoward such understanding in a limited field—in particular, an\nendeavor to point out some contrasting relationships between the\npresent and the past in our underlying attitudes toward invest-\nment and speculation in common stocks.\nLet me start with a summary of my thesis. In the past the specu-\nlative elements of a common stock resided almost exclusively in\nthe company itself; they were due to uncertainties, or fluctuating\nelements, or downright weaknesses in the industry, or the corpora-\ntion’s individual setup. These elements of speculation still exist, of\ncourse; but it may be said that they have been sensibly diminished\nby a number of long-term developments to which I shall refer. But\nin revenge a new and major element of speculation has been intro-\nduced into the common-stock arena from outsidethe companies. It\ncomes from the attitude and viewpoint of the stock-buying public\nand their advisers—chiefly us security analysts. This attitude may\nbe described in a phrase: primary emphasis upon future expecta-\ntions.\nNothing will appear more logical and natural to this audience\nthan the idea that a common stock should be valued and priced\nwww.fx1618.com564 Appendixes\nprimarily on the basis of the company’s expected future perfor-\nmance. Yet this simple-appearing concept carries with it a number\nof paradoxes and pitfalls. For one thing, it obliterates a good part of\nthe older, well-established distinctions between investment and\nspeculation. The dictionary says that “speculate” comes from the\nLatin “specula,” a lookout. Thus it was the speculator who looked\nout and saw future developments coming before other people did.\nBut today, if the investor is shrewd or well advised, he too must\nhave his lookout on the future, or rather he mounts into a common\nlookout where he rubs elbows with the speculator.\nSecondly, we find that, for the most part, companies with the\nbest investment characteristics—i.e., the best credit rating—are the\nones which are likely to attract the largest speculative interest in\ntheir common stocks, since everyone assumes they are guaranteed\na brilliant future. Thirdly, the concept of future prospects, and par-\nticularly of continued growth in the future, invites the application\nof formulas out of higher mathematics to establish the present\nvalue of the favored issues. But the combination of precise formu-\nlas with highly imprecise assumptions can be used to establish, or\nrather to justify, practically any value one wishes, however high,\nfor a really outstanding issue. But, paradoxically, that very fact on\nclose examination will be seen to imply that no one value, or rea-\nsonably narrow range of values, can be counted on to establish and\nmaintain itself for a given growth company; hence at times the\nmarket may conceivably value the growth component at a strik-\ninglylowfigure.\nReturning to my distinction between the older and newer spec-\nulative elements in common stock, we might characterize them by\ntwo outlandish but convenient words, viz.: endogenous and exoge-\nnous. Let me illustrate briefly the old-time speculative common\nstock, as distinguished from an investment stock, by some data\nrelating to American Can and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1911–1913.\n(These appear in Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd, Security\nAnalysis,McGraw-Hill, 1940, pp. 2–3.)\nIn those three years the price range of “Pennsy” moved only\nbetween 53 and 65, or between 12.2 and 15 times its average earn-\nings for the period. It showed steady profits, was paying a reliable\n$3 dividend, and investors were sure that it was backed by well\nover its par of $50 in tangible assets. By contrast, the price of Amer-\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 565\nican Can ranged between 9 and 47; its earnings between 7 cents\nand $8.86; the ratio of price to the three-year average earnings\nmoved between 1.9 times and 10 times; it paid no dividend at all;\nand sophisticated investors were well aware that the $100 par\nvalue of the common represented nothing but undisclosed\n“water,” since the preferred issue exceeded the tangible assets\navailable for it. Thus American Can common was a representative\nspeculative issue, because American Can Company was then a\nspeculatively capitalized enterprise in a fluctuating and uncertain\nindustry. Actually, American Can had a far more brilliant long-\nterm future than Pennsylvania Railroad; but not only was this fact\nnot suspected by investors or speculators in those days, but even if\nit had been it would probably have been put aside by the investors\nas basically irrelevant to investment policies and programs in the\nyears 1911–1913.\nNow, to expose you to the development through time of the\nimportance of long-term prospects for investments. I should like to\nuse as my example our most spectacular giant industrial enter-\nprise—none other than International Business Machines, which\nlast year entered the small group of companies with $1 billion of\nsales. May I introduce one or two autobiographical notes here, in\norder to inject a little of the personal touch into what otherwise\nwould be an excursion into cold figures? In 1912 I had left college\nfor a term to take charge of a research project for U.S. Express Com-\npany. We set out to find the effect on revenues of a proposed revo-\nlutionary new system of computing express rates. For this purpose\nwe used the so-called Hollerith machines, leased out by the then\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Company. They comprised card\npunches, card sorters, and tabulators—tools almost unknown to\nbusinessmen, then, and having their chief application in the Cen-\nsus Bureau. I entered Wall Street in 1914, and the next year the\nbonds and common stock of C.-T.-R. Company were listed on the\nNew York Stock Exchange. Well, I had a kind of sentimental inter-\nest in that enterprise, and besides I considered myself a sort of\ntechnological expert on their products, being one of the few finan-\ncial people who had seen and used them. So early in 1916 I went to\nthe head of my firm, known as Mr. A. N., and pointed out to him\nthat C.-T.-R. stock was selling in the middle 40s (for 105,000\nshares); that it had earned $6.50 in 1915; that its book value—\nwww.fx1618.com566 Appendixes\nincluding, to be sure, some nonsegregated intangibles—was $130;\nthat it had started a $3 dividend; and that I thought rather highly of\nthe company’s products and prospects. Mr. A. N. looked at me\npityingly. “Ben,” said he, “do not mention that company to me\nagain. I would not touch it with a ten-foot pole. [His favorite\nexpression.] Its 6 per cent bonds are selling in the low 80s and they\nare no good. So how can the stock be any good? Everybody knows\nthere is nothing behind it but water.” (Glossary: In those days that\nwas the ultimate of condemnation. It meant that the asset account\nof the balance sheet was fictitious. Many industrial companies—\nnotably U.S. Steel—despite their $100 par, represented nothing but\nwater, concealed in a written-up plant account. Since they had\n“nothing” to back them but earning power and future prospects,\nno self-respecting investor would give them a second thought.)\nI returned to my statistician’s cubbyhole, a chastened young\nman. Mr. A. N. was not only experienced and successful, but\nextremely shrewd as well. So much was I impressed by his sweep-\ning condemnation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording that I\nnever bought a share of it in my life, not even after its name was\nchanged to International Business Machines in 1926.\nNow let us take a look at the same company with its new name\nin 1926, a year of pretty high stock markets. At that time it first\nrevealed the good-will item in its balance sheet, in the rather large\nsum of $13.6 million. A. N. had been right. Practically every dollar\nof the so-called equity behind the common in 1915 had been noth-\ning but water. However, since that time the company had made an\nimpressive record under the direction of T. L. Watson, Sr. Its net\nhad risen from $691,000 to $3.7 million—over fivefold—a greater\npercentage gain than it was to make in any subsequent eleven-year\nperiod. It had built up a nice tangible equity for the common, and\nhad split it 3.6 for one. It had established a $3 dividend rate for the\nnew stock, while earnings were $6.39 thereon. You might have\nexpected the 1926 stock market to have been pretty enthusiastic\nabout a company with such a growth history and so strong a trade\nposition. Let us see. The price range for that year was 31 low, 59\nhigh. At the average of 45 it was selling at the same 7-times multi-\nplier of earnings and the same 6.7 per cent dividend yield as it had\ndone in 1915. At its low of 31 it was not far in excess of its tangible\nbook value, and in that respect was far more conservatively priced\nthan elewvewn ywea.frxs 1ea6rl1ie8r..comAppendixes 567\nThese data illustrate, as well as any can, the persistence of the\nold-time investment viewpoint until the culminating years of the\nbull market of the 1920s. What has happened since then can be\nsummarized by using ten-year intervals in the history of IBM. In\n1936 net expanded to twice the 1926 figures, and the average multi-\nplier rose from 7 to 171⁄. From 1936 to 1946 the gain was 21⁄ times,\n2 2\nbut the average multiplier in 1946 remained at 171⁄ 2.Then the pace\naccelerated. The 1956 net was nearly 4 times that of 1946, and the\naverage multiplier rose to 321⁄. Last year, with a further gain in net,\n2\nthe multiplier rose again to an average of 42, if we do not count the\nunconsolidated equity in the foreign subsidiary.\nWhen we examine these recent price figures with care we see\nsome interesting analogies and contrasts with those of forty years\nearlier. The one-time scandalous water, so prevalent in the balance\nsheets of industrial companies, has all been squeezed out—first by\ndisclosure and then by writeoffs. But a different kind of water has\nbeen put back into the valuation by the stock market—by investors\nand speculators themselves. When IBM now sells at 7 times its\nbook value, instead of 7 times earnings, the effect is practically the\nsame as if it had no book value at all. Or the small book-value por-\ntion can be considered as a sort of minor preferred-stock compo-\nnent of the price, the rest representing exactly the same sort of\ncommitment as the old-time speculator made when he bought\nWoolworth or U.S. Steel common entirely for their earning power\nand future prospects.\nIt is worth remarking, in passing, that in the thirty years which\nsaw IBM transformed from a 7-times earnings to a 40-times earn-\nings enterprise, many of what I have called the endogenous specu-\nlative aspects of our large industrial companies have tended to\ndisappear, or at least to diminish greatly. Their financial positions\nare firm, their capital structures conservative: they are managed far\nmore expertly, and even more honestly, than before. Furthermore,\nthe requirements of complete disclosure have removed one of the\nimportant speculative elements of years ago—that derived from\nignorance and mystery.\nAnother personal digression here. In my early years in the Street\none of the favorite mystery stocks was Consolidated Gas of New\nYork, now Consolidated Edison. It owned as a subsidiary the prof-\nitable New York Edison Company, but it reported only dividends\nreceiwvewd fwro.mfx t1hi6s 1so8u.rcceo, nmot its full earnings. The unreported Edi-568 Appendixes\nson earnings supplied the mystery and the “hidden value.” To my\nsurprise I discovered that these hush-hush figures were actually on\nfile each year with the Public Service Commission of the state. It\nwas a simple matter to consult the records and to present the true\nearnings of Consolidated Gas in a magazine article. (Incidentally,\nthe addition to profits was not spectacular.) One of my older\nfriends said to me then: “Ben, you may think you are a great guy to\nsupply those missing figures, but Wall Street is going to thank you\nfor nothing. Consolidated Gas with the mystery is both more inter-\nesting and more valuable than ex-mystery. You youngsters who\nwant to stick your noses into everything are going to ruin Wall\nStreet.”\nIt is true that the three M’s which then supplied so much fuel to\nthe speculative fires have now all but disappeared. These were\nMystery, Manipulation, and (thin) Margins. But we security ana-\nlysts have ourselves been creating valuation approaches which are\nso speculative in themselves as to pretty well take the place of\nthose older speculative factors. Do we not have our own “3M’s”\nnow—none other than Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing\nCompany—and does not this common stock illustrate perfectly the\nnew speculation as contrasted with the old? Consider a few fig-\nures. When M. M. & M. common sold at 101 last year the market\nwas valuing it at 44 times 1956 earnings, which happened to show\nno increase to speak of in 1957. The enterprise itself was valued at\n$1.7 billion, of which $200 million was covered by net assets, and a\ncool $11⁄ billion represented the market’s appraisal of “good will.”\n2\nWedo not know the process of calculation by which that valuation\nof good will was arrived at; we do know that a few months later\nthe market revised this appraisal downward by some $450 million,\nor about 30 per cent. Obviously it is impossible to calculate accu-\nrately the intangible component of a splendid company such as\nthis. It follows as a kind of mathematical law that the more impor-\ntant the good will or future earning-power factor the more uncer-\ntain becomes the true value of the enterprise, and therefore the\nmore speculative inherently the common stock.\nIt may be well to recognize a vital difference that has developed\nin the valuation of these intangible factors, when we compare ear-\nlier times with today. Ageneration or more ago it was the standard\nrule, recognized both in average stock prices and in formal or legal\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 569\nvaluations, that intangibles were to be appraised on a more conser-\nvative basis than tangibles. A good industrial company might be\nrequired to earn between 6 per cent and 8 per cent on its tangible\nassets, represented typically by bonds and preferred stock; but its\nexcess earnings, or the intangible assets they gave rise to, would be\nvalued on, say, a 15 per cent basis. (You will find approximately\nthese ratios in the initial offering of Woolworth preferred and com-\nmon stock in 1911, and in numerous others.) But what has hap-\npened since the 1920s? Essentially the exact reverse of these\nrelationships may now be seen. A company must now typically\nearn about 10 per cent on its common equity to have it sell in the\naverage market at full book value. But its excess earnings, above 10\nper cent on capital, are usually valued more liberally, or at a higher\nmultiplier, than the base earnings required to support the book\nvalue in the market. Thus a company earning 15 per cent on the\nequity may well sell at 131⁄ times earnings, or twice its net assets.\n2\nThis would mean that the first 10 per cent earned on capital is val-\nued at only 10 times, but the next 5 per cent—what used to be\ncalled the “excess”—is actually valued at 20 times.\nNow there is a logical reason for this reversal in valuation proce-\ndure, which is related to the newer emphasis on growth expecta-\ntions. Companies that earn a high return on capital are given these\nliberal appraisals not only because of the good profitability itself,\nand the relative stability associated with it, but perhaps even more\ncogently because high earnings on capital generally go hand in\nhand with a good growth record and prospects. Thus what is really\npaid for nowadays in the case of highly profitable companies is not\nthe good will in the old and restricted sense of an established name\nand a profitable business, but rather their assumed superior expec-\ntations of increased profits in the future.\nThis brings me to one or two additional mathematical aspects of\nthe new attitude toward common-stock valuations, which I shall\ntouch on merely in the form of brief suggestions. If, as many tests\nshow, the earnings multiplier tends to increase with profitability—\ni.e., as the rate of return on book value increases—then the arith-\nmetical consequence of this feature is that value tends to increase\ndirectly as the square of the earnings, but inverselythe book value.\nThus in an important and very real sense tangible assets have\nbecome a drag on average market value rather than a source\nwww.fx1618.com570 Appendixes\nthereof. Take a far from extreme illustration. If Company Aearns $4\na share on a $20 book value, and Company B also $4 a share on\n$100 book value, Company Ais almost certain to sell at a higher\nmultiplier, and hence at higher price than Company B—say $60 for\nCompany Ashares and $35 for Company B shares. Thus it would\nnot be inexact to declare that the $80 per share of greater assets for\nCompany B are responsible for the $25 per share lower market\nprice, since the earnings per share are assumed to be equal.\nBut more important than the foregoing is the general relation-\nship between mathematics and the new approach to stock values.\nGiven the three ingredients of (a) optimistic assumptions as to the\nrate of earnings growth, (b) a sufficiently long projection of this\ngrowth into the future, and (c) the miraculous workings of com-\npound interest—lo! the security analyst is supplied with a new\nkind of philosopher’s stone which can produce or justify any\ndesired valuation for a really “good stock.” I have commented in a\nrecent article in the Analysts’Journalon the vogue of higher mathe-\nmatics in bull markets, and quoted David Durand’s exposition of\nthe striking analogy between value calculations of growth stocks\nand the famous Petersburg Paradox, which has challenged and\nconfused mathematicians for more than two hundred years. The\npoint I want to make here is that there is a special paradox in the\nrelationship between mathematics and investment attitudes on\ncommon stocks, which is this: Mathematics is ordinarily consid-\nered as producing precise and dependable results; but in the stock\nmarket the more elaborate and abstruse the mathematics the more\nuncertain and speculative are the conclusions we draw therefrom.\nIn forty-four years of Wall Street experience and study I have never\nseen dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or\nrelated investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or\nthe most elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in,\nor higher algebra, you could take it as a warning signal that the\noperator was trying to substitute theory for experience, and usu-\nally also to give to speculation the deceptive guise of investment.\nThe older ideas of common-stock investment may seem quite\nnaïve to the sophisticated security analyst of today. The great\nemphasis was always on what we now call the defensive aspects of\nthe company or issue—mainly the assurance that it would con-\ntinue its dividend unreduced in bad times. Thus the strong rail-\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 571\nroads, which constituted the standard investment commons of fifty\nyears ago, were actually regarded in very much the same way as\nthe public-utility commons in recent years. If the past record indi-\ncated stability, the chief requirement was met; not too much effort\nwas made to anticipate adverse changes of an underlying character\nin the future. But, conversely, especially favorable future prospects\nwere regarded by shrewd investors as something to look for but\nnot to pay for.\nIn effect this meant that the investor did not have to pay any-\nthing substantial for superior long-term prospects. He got these,\nvirtually without extra cost, as a reward for his own superior intel-\nligence and judgment in picking the best rather than the merely\ngood companies. For common stocks with the same financial\nstrength, past earnings record, and dividend stability all sold at\nabout the same dividend yield.\nThis was indeed a shortsighted point of view, but it had the\ngreat advantage of making common-stock investment in the old\ndays not only simple but also basically sound and highly prof-\nitable. Let me return for the last time to a personal note. Some-\nwhere around 1920 our firm distributed a series of little pamphlets\nentitledLessons for Investors.Of course it took a brash analyst in his\nmiddle twenties like myself to hit on so smug and presumptuous a\ntitle. But in one of the papers I made the casual statement that “if a\ncommon stock is a good investment it is also a good speculation.”\nFor, reasoned I, if a common stock was so sound that it carried very\nlittle risk of loss it must ordinarily be so good as to possess excel-\nlent chances for future gains. Now this was a perfectly true and\neven valuable discovery, but it was true only because nobody paid\nany attention to it. Some years later, when the public woke up to\nthe historical merits of common stocks as long-term investments,\nthey soon ceased to have any such merit, because the public’s\nenthusiasm created price levels which deprived them of their built-\nin margin of safety, and thus drove them out of the investment\nclass. Then, of course, the pendulum swung to the other extreme,\nand we soon saw one of the most respected authorities declaring\n(in 1931) that no common stock could everbe an investment.\nWhen we view this long-range experience in perspective we\nfind another set of paradoxes in the investor’s changing attitude\ntoward capital gains as contrasted with income. It seems a truism\nwww.fx1618.com572 Appendixes\nto say that the old-time common-stock investor was not much\ninterested in capital gains. He bought almost entirely for safety and\nincome, and let the speculator concern himself with price apprecia-\ntion. Today we are likely to say that the more experienced and\nshrewd the investor, the less attention he pays to dividend returns,\nand the more heavily his interest centers on long-term apprecia-\ntion. Yet one might argue, perversely, that precisely because the\nold-time investor did not concentrate on future capital apprecia-\ntion he was virtually guaranteeing to himself that he would have it,\nat least in the field of industrial stocks. And, conversely, today’s\ninvestor is so concerned with anticipating the future that he is\nalready paying handsomely for it in advance. Thus what he has\nprojected with so much study and care may actually happen and\nstill not bring him any profit. If it should fail to materialize to the\ndegree expected he may in fact be faced with a serious temporary\nand perhaps even permanent loss.\nWhatlessons—again using the pretentious title of my 1920 pam-\nphlet—can the analyst of 1958 learn from this linking of past with\ncurrent attitudes? Not much of value, one is inclined to say. We can\nlook back nostalgically to the good old days when we paid only for\nthe present and could get the future for nothing—an “all this and\nHeaven too” combination. Shaking our heads sadly we mutter,\n“Those days are gone forever.” Have not investors and security\nanalysts eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil prospects?\nBy so doing have they not permanently expelled themselves from\nthat Eden where promising common stocks at reasonable prices\ncould be plucked off the bushes? Are we doomed always to run the\nrisk either of paying unreasonably high prices for good quality and\nprospects, or of getting poor quality and prospects when we pay\nwhat seems a reasonable price?\nIt certainly looks that way. Yet one cannot be sure even of that\npessimistic dilemma. Recently, I did a little research in the long-\nterm history of that towering enterprise, General Electric—stimu-\nlated by the arresting chart of fifty-nine years of earnings and\ndividends appearing in their recently published 1957 Report. These\nfigures are not without their surprises for the knowledgeable ana-\nlyst. For one thing they show that prior to 1947 the growth of G. E.\nwas fairly modest and quite irregular. The 1946 earnings, per share\nadjusted, were only 30 per cent higher than in 1902—52 cents ver-\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 573\nsus 40 cents—and in no year of this period were the 1902 earnings\nas much as doubled. Yet the price-earnings ratio rose from 9 times\nin 1910 and 1916 to 29 times in 1936 and again in 1946. One might\nsay, of course, that the 1946 multiplier at least showed the well-\nknown prescience of shrewd investors. We analysts were able to\nforesee then the really brilliant period of growth that was looming\nahead in the next decade. Maybe so. But some of you remember\nthat the next year, 1947, which established an impressive new high\nfor G.E.’s per-share earnings, was marked also by an extraordinary\nfall in the price-earnings ratio. At its low of 32 (before the 3-for-1\nsplit) G.E. actually sold again at only 9 times its current earnings\nand its average price for the year was only about 10 times earnings.\nOur crystal ball certainly clouded over in the short space of twelve\nmonths.\nThis striking reversal took place only eleven years ago. It casts\nsome little doubt in my mind as to the complete dependability of\nthe popular belief among analysts that prominent and promising\ncompanies will now always sell at high price-earnings ratios—that\nthis is a fundamental fact of life for investors and they may as well\naccept and like it. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic on this\npoint. All I can say is that it is not settled in my mind, and each of\nyou must seek to settle it for yourself.\nBut in my concluding remarks I can say something definite\nabout the structure of the market for various types of common\nstocks, in terms of their investment and speculative characteristics.\nIn the old days the investment character of a common stock was\nmore or less the same as, or proportionate with, that of the enter-\nprise itself, as measured quite well by its credit rating. The lower\nthe yield on its bonds or preferred, the more likely was the com-\nmon to meet all the criteria for a satisfactory investment, and the\nsmaller the element of speculation involved in its purchase. This\nrelationship, between the speculative ranking of the common and\nthe investment rating of the company, could be graphically\nexpressed pretty much as a straight line descending from left to\nright. But nowadays I would describe the graph as U-shaped. At\nthe left, where the company itself is speculative and its credit low,\nthe common stock is of course highly speculative, just as it has\nalways been in the past. At the right extremity, however, where the\ncompany has the highest credit rating because both its past record\nwww.fx1618.com574 Appendixes\nand future prospects are most impressive, we find that the stock\nmarket tends more or less continuously to introduce a highly spec-\nulative element into the common shares through the simple means\nof a price so high as to carry a fair degree of risk.\nAt this point I cannot forbear introducing a surprisingly rele-\nvant, if quite exaggerated, quotation on the subject which I found\nrecently in one of Shakespeare’s sonnets. It reads:\nHave I not seen dwellers on form and favor\nLose all and more by paying too much rent?\nReturning to my imaginary graph, it would be the center area\nwhere the speculative element in common-stock purchases would\ntend to reach its minimum. In this area we could find many well-\nestablished and strong companies, with a record of past growth\ncorresponding to that of the national economy and with future\nprospects apparently of the same character. Such common stocks\ncould be bought at most times, except in the upper ranges of a bull\nmarket, at moderate prices in relation to their indicated intrinsic\nvalues. As a matter of fact, because of the present tendency of\ninvestors and speculators alike to concentrate on more glamorous\nissues, I should hazard the statement that these middle-ground\nstocks tend to sell on the whole rather below their independently\ndeterminable values. They thus have a margin-of-safety factor sup-\nplied by the same market preferences and prejudices which tend to\ndestroy the margin of safety in the more promising issues. Further-\nmore, in this wide array of companies there is plenty of room for\npenetrating analysis of the past record and for discriminating\nchoice in the area of future prospects, to which can be added the\nhigher assurance of safety conferred by diversification.\nWhen Phaëthon insisted on driving the chariot of the Sun, his\nfather, the experienced operator, gave the neophyte some advice\nwhich the latter failed to follow—to his cost. Ovid summed up\nPhoebus Apollo’s counsel in three words:\nMedius tutissimus ibis\nYou will go safest in the middle course\nI think this principle holds good for investors and their security\nanalyst advisers.\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 575\n5. ACase History: Aetna Maintenance Co.\nThe first part of this history is reproduced from our 1965 edition,\nwhere it appeared under the title “AHorrible Example.” The sec-\nond part summarizes the later metamorphosis of the enterprise.\nWe think it might have a salutary effect on our readers’ future\nattitude toward new common-stock offerings if we cited one “hor-\nrible example” here in some detail. It is taken from the first page of\nStandard & Poor’s Stock Guide, and illustrates in extreme fashion\nthe glaring weaknesses of the 1960–1962 flotations, the extraordi-\nnary overvaluations given them in the market, and the subsequent\ncollapse.\nIn November 1961, 154,000 shares of Aetna Maintenance Co.\ncommon were sold to public at $9 and the price promptly\nadvanced to $15. Before the financing the net assets per share were\nabout $1.20, but they were increased to slightly over $3 per share\nby the money received for the new shares.\nThe sales and earnings prior to the financing were:\nYear Ended Sales Net for Earned\nCommon Per Share\nJune 1961 $3,615,000 $187,000 $0.69\n(June 1960)* (1,527,000) (25,000) (0.09)\nDecember 1959 2,215,000 48,000 0.17\nDecember 1958 1,389,000 16,000 0.06\nDecember 1957 1,083,000 21,000 0.07\nDecember 1956 1,003,000 2,000 0.01\n*For six months.\nThe corresponding figures after the financing were:\nJune 1963 $4,681,000 $ 42,000(def.) $0.11(def.)\nJune 1962 4,234,000 149,000 0.36\nIn 1962 the price fell to 22⁄, and in 1964 it sold as low as 7⁄. No divi-\n3 8\ndends were paid during this period.\nCOMMENT: This was much too small a business for public partic-\nipation. The stock was sold—and bought—on the basis of one good\nyear;the results previously had been derisory. There was nothing in\nwww.fx1618.com576 Appendixes\nthe nature of this highly competitive business to insure future sta-\nbility. At the high price soon after issuance the heedless public was\npaying much more per dollar of earnings and assets than for most\nof our large and strong companies. This example is admittedly\nextreme, but it is far from unique; the instances of lesser, but inex-\ncusable, overvaluations run into the hundreds.\nSequel 1965–1970\nIn 1965 new interests came into the company. The unprofitable\nbuilding-maintenance business was sold out, and the company em-\nbarked in an entirely different venture: making electronic devices.\nThe name was changed to Haydon Switch and Instrument Co. The\nearnings results have not been impressive. In the five years\n1965–1969 the enterprise showed average earnings of only 8 cents\nper share of “old stock,” with 34 cents earned in the best year, 1967.\nHowever, in true modern style, the company split the stock 2 for 1 in\n1968. The market price also ran true to Wall Street form. It advanced\nfrom 7⁄ in 1964 to the equivalent of 161⁄ in 1968 (after the split). The\n8 2\nprice now exceeded the record set in the enthusiastic days of 1961.\nThis time the overvaluation was much worse than before. The stock\nwas now selling at 52 times the earnings of its only good year, and\nsome 200 times its average earnings. Also, the company was again to\nreport a deficit in the very year that the new high price was estab-\nlished. The next year, 1969, the bid price fell to $1.\nQUESTIONS: Did the idiots who paid $8+ for this stock in 1968\nknow anything at all about the company’s previous history, its\nfive-year earnings record, its asset value (very small)? Did they\nhave any idea of how much—or rather how little—they were get-\nting for their money? Did they care? Has anyone on Wall Street any\nresponsibility at all for the regular recurrence of completely brain-\nless, shockingly widespread, and inevitable catastrophic specula-\ntion in this kind of vehicle?\n6. Tax Accounting for NVF’s Acquisition of Sharon\nSteel Shares\n1. NVF acquired 88% of Sharon stock in 1969, paying for each\nshare $70 in NVF 5% bonds, due 1994, and warrants to buy 11⁄\n2\nwww.fx1618.comAppendixes 577\nshares of NVF at $22 per share. The initial market value of the\nbonds appears to have been only 43% of par, while the warrants\nwere quoted at $10 per NVF share involved. This meant that the\nSharon holders got only $30 worth of bonds but $15 worth of war-\nrants for each share turned in, a total of $45 per share. (This was\nabout the average price of Sharon in 1968, and also its closing price\nfor the year.) The book value of Sharon was $60 per share. The dif-\nference between this book value and the market value of Sharon\nstock amounted to about $21 million on the 1,415,000 shares of\nSharon acquired.\n2. The accounting treatment was designed to accomplish three\nthings: (a) To treat the issuance of the bonds as equivalent to a\n“sale” thereof at 43, giving the company an annual deduction from\nincome for amortization of the huge bond discount of $54 million.\n(Actually it would be charging itself about 15% annual interest on\nthe “proceeds” of the $99 million debenture issue.) (b)To offset this\nbond-discount charge by an approximately equal “profit,” consist-\ning of a credit to income of one-tenth of the difference between the\ncost price of 45 for the Sharon stock and its book value of 60. (This\nwould correspond, in reverse fashion, to the required practice of\nchargingincome each year with a part of the price paid for acquisi-\ntions in excess of the book value of the assets acquired.) (c) The\nbeauty of this arrangement would be that the company could save\ninitially about $900,000 a year, or $1 per share, in income taxes from\nthese two annual entries, because the amortization of bond dis-\ncount could be deducted from taxable income but the amortization\nof “excess of equity over cost” did not have to be included in tax-\nable income.\n3. This accounting treatment is reflected in both the consoli-\ndated income account and the consolidated balance sheet of NVF\nfor 1969, and pro forma for 1968. Since a good part of the cost of\nSharon stock was to be treated as paid for by warrants, it was nec-\nessary to show the initial market value of the warrants as part of\nthe common-stock capital figure. Thus in this case, as in no other\nthat we know, the warrants were assigned a substantial value in\nthe balance sheet, namely $22 million+ (but only in an explanatory\nnote).\nwww.fx1618.com578 Appendixes\n7. Technological Companies as Investments\nIn the Standard & Poor’s services in mid-1971 there were listed\nabout 200 companies with names beginning with Compu-, Data,\nElectro-, Scien-, Techno-. About half of these belonged to some part\nof the computer industry. All of them were traded in the market or\nhad made applications to sell stock to the public.\nAtotal of 46 such companies appeared in the S & PStock Guide\nfor September 1971. Of these, 26 were reporting deficits, only six\nwere earning over $1 per share, and only five were paying divi-\ndends.\nIn the December 1968 Stock Guidethere had appeared 45 compa-\nnies with similar technological names. Tracing the sequel of this\nlist, as shown in the September 1971 Guide, we find the following\ndevelopments:\nTotal Price Price Declined Price Declined Dropped from\nCompanies Advanced Less Than Half More Than Half Stock Guide\n45 2 8 23 12\nCOMMENT: It is virtually certain that the many technological\ncompanies not included in the Guide in 1968 had a poorer subse-\nquent record than those that were included; also that the 12 compa-\nnies dropped from the list did worse than those that were retained.\nThe harrowing results shown by these samples are no doubt rea-\nsonably indicative of the quality and price history of the entire\ngroup of “technology” issues. The phenomenal success of IBM and\na few other companies was bound to produce a spate of public\nofferings of new issues in their fields, for which large losses were\nvirtually guaranteed.\nwww.fx1618.comEndnotes\nIntroduction: What This Book Expects to Accomplish\n1. “Letter stock” is stock not registered for sale with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and for which the buyer supplies a let-\nter stating the purchase was for investment.\n2. The foregoing are Moody’s figures for AAA bonds and industrial\nstocks.\nChapter 1. Investment versus Speculation:\nResults to Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor\n1. Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd, Sidney Cottle, and Charles\nTatham, McGraw-Hill, 4th. ed., 1962. A fascimile copy of the 1934 edi-\ntion of Security Analysiswas reissued in 1996 (McGraw-Hill).\n2. This is quoted from Investment and Speculation, by Lawrence Cham-\nberlain, published in 1931.\n3. In a survey made by the Federal Reserve Board.\n4. 1965 edition, p. 8.\n5. We assume here a top tax bracket for the typical investor of 40%\napplicable to dividends and 20% applicable to capital gains.\nChapter 2. The Investor and Inflation\n1. This was written before President Nixon’s price-and-wage “freeze” in\nAugust 1971, followed by his “Phase 2” system of controls. These\nimportant developments would appear to confirm the views\nexpressed above.\n2. The rate earned on the Standard & Poor’s index of 425 industrial\nstocks was about 111⁄ 2% on asset value—due in part to the inclusion\nof the large and highly profitable IBM, which is not one of the DJIA\n30 issues.\nwww.fx1618.com\n579580 Endnotes\n3. Achart issued by American Telephone & Telegraph in 1971 indi-\ncates that the rates charged for residential telephone services\nwere somewhat less in 1970 than in 1960.\n4. Reported in the Wall Street Journal,October, 1970.\nChapter 3. ACentury of Stock-Market History:\nThe Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972\n1. Both Standard & Poor’s and Dow Jones have separate averages for\npublic utilities and transportation (chiefly railroad) companies. Since\n1965 the New York Stock Exchange has computed an index represent-\ning the movement of all its listed common shares.\n2. Made by the Center for Research in Security Prices of the University\nof Chicago, under a grant from the Charles E. Merrill Foundation.\n3. This was first written in early 1971 with the DJIAat 940. The contrary\nview held generally on Wall Street was exemplified in a detailed\nstudy which reached a median valuation of 1520 for the DJIAin 1975.\nThis would correspond to a discounted value of, say, 1200 in mid-\n1971. In March 1972 the DJIAwas again at 940 after an intervening\ndecline to 798. Again, Graham was right. The “detailed study” he men-\ntions was too optimistic by an entire decade: The Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage did not close above 1520 until December 13, 1985!\nChapter 4. General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor\n1. Ahigher tax-free yield, with sufficient safety, can be obtained from\ncertainIndustrial Revenue Bonds,a relative newcomer among financial\ninventions. They would be of interest particularly to the enterprising\ninvestor.\nChapter 5. The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks\n1. Practical Formulas for Successful Investing,Wilfred Funk, Inc., 1953.\n2. In current mathematical approaches to investment decisions, it has be-\ncome standard practice to define “risk” in terms of average price varia-\ntions or “volatility.” See, for example, An Introduction to Risk and Return,\nby Richard A. Brealey, The M.I.T. Press, 1969. We find this use of the\nword “risk” more harmful than useful for sound investment deci-\nsions—because it places too much emphasis on market fluctuations.\n3. All 30 companies in the DJIAmet this standard in 1971.\nwww.fx1618.comEndnotes 581\nChapter 6. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor:\nNegative Approach\n1. In 1970 the Milwaukee road reported a large deficit. It suspended\ninterest payments on its income bonds, and the price of the 5% issue\nfell to 10.\n2. For example: Cities Service $6 first preferred, not paying dividends,\nsold at as low as 15 in 1937 and at 27 in 1943, when the accumulations\nhad reached $60 per share. In 1947 it was retired by exchange for\n$196.50 of 3% debentures for each share, and it sold as high as 186.\n3. An elaborate statistical study carried on under the direction of the\nNational Bureau of Economic Research indicates that such has actu-\nally been the case. Graham is referring to W. Braddock Hickman,\nCorporate Bond Quality and Investor Experience (Princeton University\nPress, 1958). Hickman’s book later inspired Michael Milken of Drexel\nBurnham Lambert to offer massive high-yield financing to companies\nwith less than sterling credit ratings, helping to ignite the leveraged-\nbuyout and hostile takeover craze of the late 1980s.\n4. A representative sample of 41 such issues taken from Standard &\nPoor’s Stock Guide shows that five lost 90% or more of their high\nprice, 30 lost more than half, and the entire group about two-thirds.\nThe many not listed in the Stock Guide undoubtedly had a larger\nshrinkage on the whole.\nChapter 7. Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor:\nThe Positive Side\n1. See, for example, Lucile Tomlinson, Practical Formulas for Successful\nInvesting; and Sidney Cottle and W. T. Whitman, Investment Timing:\nThe Formula Approach,both published in 1953.\n2. A company with an ordinary record cannot, without confusing the\nterm, be called a growth company or a “growth stock” merely\nbecause its proponent expects it to do better than the average in the\nfuture. It is just a “promising company.” Graham is making a subtle but\nimportant point: If the definition of a growth stock is a company that will\nthrive in the future, then that’s not a definition at all, but wishful thinking.\nIt’s like calling a sports team “the champions” before the season is over.\nThis wishful thinking persists today; among mutual funds, “growth” port-\nfolios describe their holdings as companies with “above-average growth\nwww.fx1618.com582 Endnotes\npotential” or “favorable prospects for earnings growth.” A better defini-\ntion might be companies whose net earnings per share have increased\nby an annual average of at least 15% for at least five years running.\n(Meeting this definition in the past does not ensure that a company will\nmeet it in the future.)\n3. See Table 7-1.\n4. Here are two age-old Wall Street proverbs that counsel such sales:\n“No tree grows to Heaven” and “Abull may make money, a bear may\nmake money, but a hog never makes money.”\n5. Two studies are available. The first, made by H. G. Schneider, one of\nour students, covers the years 1917–1950 and was published in June\n1951 in the Journal of Finance. The second was made by Drexel Fire-\nstone, members of the New York Stock Exchange, and covers the\nyears 1933–1969. The data are given here by their kind permission.\n6. See pp. 393–395, for three examples of special situations existing in\n1971.\nChapter 8. The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n1. Except, perhaps, in dollar-cost averaging plans begun at a reasonable\nprice level.\n2. But according to Robert M. Ross, authority on the Dow theory, the\nlast two buy signals, shown in December 1966 and December 1970,\nwere well below the preceding selling points.\n3. The top three ratings for bonds and preferred stocks are Aaa, Aa, and\nA, used by Moody’s, and AAA, AA, Aby Standard & Poor’s. There\nare others, going down to D.\n4. This idea has already had some adoptions in Europe—e.g., by the\nstate-owned Italian electric-energy concern on its “guaranteed float-\ning rate loan notes,” due 1980. In June 1971 it advertised in New York\nthat the annual rate of interest paid thereon for the next six months\nwould be 81⁄ 8%.\nOne such flexible arrangement was incorporated in The Toronto-\nDominion Bank’s “7%–8% debentures,” due 1991, offered in June\n1971. The bonds pay 7% to July 1976 and 8% thereafter, but the holder\nhas the option to receive his principal in July 1976.\nwww.fx1618.comEndnotes 583\nChapter 9. Investing in Investment Funds\n1. The sales charge is universally stated as a percentage of the selling\nprice, which includes the charge, making it appear lower than if\napplied to net asset value. We consider this a sales gimmick unwor-\nthy of this respectable industry.\n2. The Money Managers,by G. E. Kaplan and C. Welles, Random House,\n1969.\n3. See definition of “letter stock” on p. 579.\n4. Title of a book first published in 1852. The volume described the\n“South Sea Bubble,” the tulip mania, and other speculative binges of\nthe past. It was reprinted by Bernard M. Baruch, perhaps the only\ncontinuously successful speculator of recent times, in 1932. Comment:\nThat was locking the stable door after the horse was stolen. Charles\nMackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\n(Metro Books, New York, 2002) was first published in 1841. Neither a\nlight read nor always strictly accurate, it is an extensive look at how\nlarge numbers of people often believe very silly things—for instance, that\niron can be transmuted into gold, that demons most often show up on\nFriday evenings, and that it is possible to get rich quick in the stock\nmarket. For a more factual account, consult Edward Chancellor’s Devil\nTake the Hindmost (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, New York, 1999); for a\nlighter take, try Robert Menschel’s Markets, Mobs, and Mayhem: A\nModern Look at the Madness of Crowds (John Wiley & Sons, New\nYork, 2002).\nChapter 10. The Investor and His Advisers\n1. The examinations are given by the Institute of Chartered Financial\nAnalysts, which is an arm of the Financial Analysts Federation. The\nlatter now embraces constituent societies with over 50,000 members.\n2. The NYSE had imposed some drastic rules of valuation (known as\n“haircuts”) designed to minimize this danger, but apparently they\ndid not help sufficiently.\n3. New offerings may now be sold only by means of a prospectus pre-\npared under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis document must disclose all the pertinent facts about the issue\nand issuer, and it is fully adequate to inform the prudent investoras to\nthe exact nature of the security offered him. But the very copiousness\nwww.fx1618.com584 Endnotes\nof the data required usually makes the prospectus of prohibitive\nlength. It is generally agreed that only a small percentage of individu-\nals buying new issues read the prospectus with thoroughness. Thus\nthey are still acting mainly not on their own judgment but on that of\nthe house selling them the security or on the recommendation of the\nindividual salesman or account executive.\nChapter 11. Security Analysis for the Lay Investor:\nGeneral Approach\n1. Our textbook, Security Analysisby Benjamin Graham, David L. Dodd,\nSidney Cottle, and Charles Tatham (McGraw-Hill, 4th ed., 1962),\nretains the title originally chosen in 1934, but it covers much of the\nscope of financial analysis.\n2. With Charles McGolrick, Harper & Row, 1964, reissued by Harper-\nBusiness, 1998.\n3. These figures are from Salomon Bros., a large New York bond house.\n4. At least not by the great body of security analysts and investors.\nExceptional analysts, who can tell in advance what companies are\nlikely to deserve intensive study and have the facilities and capability\nto make it, may have continued success with this work. For details of\nsuch an approach see Philip Fisher, Common Stocks and Uncommon\nProfits,Harper & Row, 1960.\n5. On p. 295 we set forth a formula relating multipliers to the rate of\nexpected growth.\n6. Part of the fireworks in the price of Chrysler was undoubtedly\ninspired by two two-for-one stock splits taking place in the single\nyear 1963—an unprecedented phenomenon for a major company. In\nthe early 1980s, under Lee Iacocca, Chrysler did a three-peat, coming\nback from the brink of bankruptcy to become one of the best-performing\nstocks in America. However, identifying managers who can lead great\ncorporate comebacks is not as easy as it seems. When Al Dunlap took\nover Sunbeam Corp. in 1996 after restructuring Scott Paper Co. (and\ndriving its stock price up 225% in 18 months), Wall Street hailed him as\nlittle short of the Second Coming. Dunlap turned out to be a sham who\nused improper accounting and false financial statements to mislead\nSunbeam’s investors—including the revered money managers Michael\nPrice and Michael Steinhardt, who had hired him. For a keen dissection\nof Dunlap’s career, see John A. Byrne, Chainsaw (HarperCollins, New\nYork, w19w99w). .fx1618.comEndnotes 585\n7. Note that we do not suggest that this formula gives the “true value”\nof a growth stock, but only that it approximates the results of the\nmore elaborate calculations in vogue.\nChapter 12. Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings\n1. Our recommended method of dealing with the warrant dilution is\ndiscussed below. We prefer to consider the market value of the war-\nrants as an addition to the current market price of the common stock\nas a whole.\nChapter 13. AComparison of Four Listed Companies\n1. In March 1972, Emery sold at 64 times its 1971 earnings!\nChapter 14. Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor\n1. Because of numerous stock splits, etc., through the years, the actual\naverage price of the DJIAlist was about $53 per share in early 1972.\n2. In 1960 only two of the 29 industrial companies failed to show current\nassets equal to twice current liabilities, and only two failed to have\nnet current assets exceeding their debt. By December 1970 the num-\nber in each category had grown from two to twelve.\n3. But note that their combined market action from December 1970 to\nearly 1972 was poorer than that of the DJIA. This demonstrates once\nagain that no system or formula will guarantee superior market\nresults. Our requirements “guarantee” only that the portfolio-buyer is\ngetting his money’s worth.\n4. As a consequence we must exclude the majority of gas pipeline\nstocks, since these enterprises are heavily bonded. The justification\nfor this setup is the underlying structure of purchase contracts which\n“guarantee” bond payments; but the considerations here may be too\ncomplicated for the needs of a defensive investor.\nChapter 15. Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor\n1. Mutual Funds and Other Institutional Investors: A New Perspective,\nI. Friend, M. Blume, and J. Crockett, McGraw-Hill, 1970. We should\nadwd wthawt t.hfex 1196661–1897.c0 oremsults of many of the funds we studied were586 Endnotes\nsomewhat better than those of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock com-\nposite and considerably better than those of the DJIA.\n2. Personal note: Many years before the stock-market pyrotechnics in\nthat particular company the author was its “financial vice-president”\nat the princely salary of $3,000 per annum. It was then really in the\nfireworks business. In early 1929, Graham became a financial vice pres-\nident of Unexcelled Manufacturing Co., the nation’s largest producer of\nfireworks. Unexcelled later became a diversified chemical company and\nno longer exists in independent form.\n3. The Guide does not show multipliers above 99. Most such would be\nmathematical oddities, caused by earnings just above the zero point.\nChapter 16. Convertible Issues and Warrants\n1. This point is well illustrated by an offering of two issues of Ford\nMotor Finance Co. made simultaneously in November 1971. One was\na 20-year nonconvertible bond, yielding 71⁄ 2%. The other was a 25-year\nbond, subordinated to the first in order of claim and yielding only\n41⁄ 2%; but it was made convertible into Ford Motor stock, against its\nthen price of 681⁄ 2 .Toobtain the conversion privilege the buyer gave\nup 40% of income and accepted a junior-creditor position.\n2. Note that in late 1971 Studebaker-Worthington common sold as low\nas 38 while the $5 preferred sold at or about 77. The spread had thus\ngrown from 2 to 20 points during the year, illustrating once more the\ndesirability of such switches and also the tendency of the stock mar-\nket to neglect arithmetic. (Incidentally the small premium of the pre-\nferred over the common in December 1970 had already been made up\nby its higher dividend.)\nChapter 17. Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories\n1. See, for example, the article “Six Flags at Half Mast,” by Dr. A. J.\nBriloff, in Barron’s,January 11, 1971.\nChapter 18. AComparison of Eight Pairs of Companies\n1. The reader will recall from p. 434 above that AAAEnterprises tried to\nenter this business, but quickly failed. Here Graham is making a pro-\nwww.fx1618.comEndnotes 587\nfound and paradoxical observation: The more money a company makes,\nthe more likely it is to face new competition, since its high returns signal\nso clearly that easy money is to be had. The new competition, in turn, will\nlead to lower prices and smaller profits. This crucial point was over-\nlooked by overenthusiastic Internet stock buyers, who believed that early\nwinners would sustain their advantage indefinitely.\nChapter 19. Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy\n1. Analytical studies have shown that in the typical case a dollar paid\nout in dividends had as much as four times the positive effect on mar-\nket price as had a dollar of undistributed earnings. This point was\nwell illustrated by the public-utility group for a number of years\nbefore 1950. The low-payout issues sold at low multipliers of earn-\nings, and proved to be especially attractive buys because their divi-\ndends were later advanced. Since 1950 payout rates have been much\nmore uniform for the industry.\nChapter 20. “Margin of Safety” as the Central Concept\nof Investment\n1. This argument is supported by Paul Hallingby, Jr., “Speculative\nOpportunities in Stock-Purchase Warrants,” Analysts’ Journal, third\nquarter 1947.\nPostscript\n1. Veracity requires the admission that the deal almost fell through\nbecause the partners wanted assurance that the purchase price would\nbe 100% covered by asset value. Afuture $300 million or more in mar-\nket gain turned on, say, $50,000 of accounting items. By dumb luck\nthey got what they insisted on.\nAppendixes\n1.
